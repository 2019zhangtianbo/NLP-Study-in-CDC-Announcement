0,3548314325246903,Michael Black,ROOT,1,HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS? The numbers continue to be on the decline but the positivity rate indicates that we might be on the road to herd immunity without very many receiving the vaccine. The ones who take greater precautions are not as easily getting sick.
1,3548314325246903,Tamera Ivy,Michael Black,0,"Michael Black, how can we be on the road to herd immunity when people are becoming reinfected? "
2,3548314325246903,Michael Black,Tamera Ivy,1,"Tamera Ivy natural immunity will fade over time. Since most of the infections happened in the last few months, a huge part of our population has already had it. Take a multiplier of 5 to 8 to the number of people that our DOH says that have had it and you see the potential for spread had dropped. The ones that are left are either lucky or take steps like wearing masks and staying home. The reinfection rate is not being measured or reported as widespread yet. We have only anecdotal evidence right now, but no clear numbers. How it all plays out - continued sick at a low rate or it disappears as a problem - we will have to see. We might be wearing masks from now on depending on where you live or if your employer mandates it."
3,3548314325246903,Tamera Ivy,Michael Black,0,"Michael Black ah, okay, I understand where you‚Äôre coming from... and you‚Äôre right, there have definitely been far more positive cases than have been reported.  I do know people who had it early on and contracted it again around Thanksgiving. So, while many currently have immunity, others are losing theirs and becoming reinfected. Either way, the numbers (including hospitalizations) are going down, and that is a good thing. Hopefully they continue to drop.  I think we have a low enough population, and population density that we could really have it under control if the proper measures were taken."
4,3548314325246903,Allison Murphy,Michael Black,0,"LISTEN numbers ARE NOT GOING DOWN!   ON average there has been a 1,000 less tests given a day! Positivity rate is still high!!  South Dakota Dept of Health  @SDDOH  reports 444 new CoV infections in SD residents.  444 among 1181 unique person results; pTPR=37.6% 5518 total results reported; TPR=8.0%  297 currently in hospital; net +4 33 new SD res EVER in hosp 24 deaths"

12,3548314325246903,Kathy Jo Lembcke,Tamera Ivy,1,Tamera Ivy the impression you are giving out with your comments is that you get a a rush over higher numbers.  That is my opinion.  You have flaunted your own ignorance by putting down anyone who has a different opinion.
13,3548314325246903,Thomas Dossett,Tamera Ivy,1,Tamera Ivy what happened to the Thanksgiving spike
14,3548314325246903,Stephanie A. Hansen,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass,0,"Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass Herd immunity occurs when 70 to 90% of a population carries antibodies to a virus. The population of SD now is approximately 885,000. According to today's DOH post, 97,676 people have been infected. Even if you multiple that by 3 (to reflect those who have had or currently have the virus and don't  know or haven't been tested, which brings the total infected to 293,028) that reflects only 33% of the population carrying antibodies. Factor in the fact that natural immunity may fade and allow for reinfection for some people and that percentage drops. We are months and maybe a year away from herd immunity if we ever achieve it given a virus's nature to mutate. Just as with influenza, we may never develop herd immunity and have to be immunized yearly. Coronavirus is here to stay."
15,3548314325246903,Tamera Ivy,Thomas Dossett,0,"Thomas Dossett, I didn‚Äôt say anything about a Thanksgiving spike. That was Kathy... ask her.  If you really want to know, our testing dropped by over 30% in that timeframe and our positivity rates are incredibly high (and still are) which tells us there are (and were) far more cases than are being identified. It‚Äôs simple math, really."
16,3548314325246903,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass,Stephanie A. Hansen,1,"Stephanie A. Hansen what if you think there is at least 10 instead of using 3???? That puts us at 976,760 that‚Äôs over the population.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Just saying....I think it‚Äôs been thru most of the colleges and a lot of the high schools already.  There will still be a few yet but their numbers are down.   How do we know???"
17,3548314325246903,Stephanie A. Hansen,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass,0,"Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass 10 is too high. If that were happening, the hospitalization and death rates would be much higher. The R0 of this virus is predicted by epidemiologists to be between 1.5 and 1.8 so every infected person infects around two people under optimal conditions. Because of the precautions most people take (hamdwashing, social distancing, mask wearing and staying home), the odds of what you are suggesting are low. If the state did more testing, especially sentinel (random) testing, we would have a better idea of infection rates, but due to a variety of factors, testing has been on the decrease. Unfortunately, none of this will be fact until many years from now when all the data is reported, collected, and analyzed."
18,3548314325246903,Tamera Ivy,Kathy Jo Lembcke,0,"Kathy Jo Lembcke, the facts surrounding this virus aren‚Äôt a matter of opinion. Math and science, lady... math and science. Now, are you really going to talk about me putting people down with a different opinion than mine when you literally commented just to take a jab at me and make assumptions about me in an attempt to put me down.... because you don‚Äôt share my opinion? Jesus, that‚Äôs contradictory.  Trust me, I don‚Äôt get a rush out of higher numbers. Again, not once have I ever indicated I was pleased by higher numbers. I‚Äôm disgusted by our numbers."
19,3548314325246903,Bradley Brill,Allison Murphy,0,"Allison Murphy exactly, and as a  state, i believe I read last week that your rate (SD) of infection is the 3rd or 4th worst in the country as a percentage of your population.  Wear your masks..it‚Äôs so simple!"
20,3548314325246903,Deirdre Dyer,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass,0,"Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass lol more like ""good job mask mandate in Sioux Falls"" for most of those numbers, with some herd immunity in the tiny rural counties. "

40,3548314325246903,Jen Slater-Unruh,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass,1,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass agreed! 
41,3548314325246903,Steve Vaughan,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass,1,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass more like low testing... herd immunity üòÜ 
42,3548314325246903,Kerry Renay Van Zee-Hass,Steve Vaughan,1,Steve Vaughan well if people aren‚Äôt sick ....wouldn‚Äôt that mean less test???  So low testing means less people are getting sick???  So that means less cases so most people aren‚Äôt getting sick because they already had it???

I'm lucky to be able to work from home on quarantine and to have an employer who proactively told me they can pay my wages for two weeks for covid-related absence and get it reimburse to them as a payroll tax credit. I've had to quarantine a total of 4 weeks so far (not consecutive) either waiting for test results or due to close contacts. But if my employer was different, I'd have lost all those wages. My boyfriend in the same boat lost all his. He has a job he can't do from home and his employer just gave him a blank stare when asked about getting paid and doing the tax credit like my job did. Why would anyone choose to put themselves out of a month's wages at this point? Especially when most folks still think covid is bs and are still doing nothing to protect themselves?"

226,3543223562422646,Tate Alexander,Tamera Ivy,1,Tamera Ivy we are also probably 49th in total population.

228,3543223562422646,Pat Mourer,Tate Alexander,0,Tate Alexander it's not new to test people with out symptoms for a disease. Have you ever had a TB test.  Nursing homes and hospitals used to not only test every new employee for TB but employees also were required to have an annual TB test.  When a new resident is admitted into a nursing home they were also required to have a TB test.  
229,3543223562422646,Tate Alexander,Pat Mourer,0,"Pat Mourer I don't call the doctor and randomly request a tb test. What you are suggesting is just testing people ""just because "" "
230,3543223562422646,Pat Mourer,Tate Alexander,0,Tate Alexander not testing just because. Testing people to prevent the spead of TB.  
231,3543223562422646,Tate Alexander,Pat Mourer,1,Pat Mourer you go ahead and get in line.  I'll get tested if I feel sick  Thanks lol

233,3543223562422646,Jayci N Lyon,Allison Murphy,1,"Allison how much more testing should be going on?! If you aren't sick or exposed, you aren't needing a test. Who should we be testing? How are these numbers manipulated?"
234,3543223562422646,Torey Walker,Tate Alexander,1,Tate Alexander stop bothering me with facts there's fear to spread
235,3543223562422646,Tamera Ivy,Jayci N Lyon,0,"Jayci N Lyon, the daily positivity rates indicate we aren‚Äôt doing enough testing. Obviously there are sick and/or exposed people who are not being tested.  This has been explained to you before... by myself and others on this page.

236,3543223562422646,Tate Alexander,Tamera Ivy,1,Tamera Ivy we are testing those who request to be tested.  There are also easily obtainable In home rapid tests available  These results are not reported.  
237,3543223562422646,Jayci N Lyon,Tamera Ivy,1,"Tamera Ivy how does the positivity rate have anything to do with it? If people are sick or exposed, they can go get tested. What more is to be done?"
238,3543223562422646,Tamera Ivy,Tate Alexander,0,"Tate Alexander, I still know people who are being denied testing... told they aren‚Äôt showing enough symptoms, or told to just assume they have covid because a family member does. "
239,3543223562422646,Tamera Ivy,Jayci N Lyon,0,"Jayci N Lyon, the positivity rates are important because they tell us we aren‚Äôt doing nearly enough testing.  The positivity rates indicate there are FAR more covid positive individuals than are being reported. "
240,3543223562422646,Tate Alexander,Tamera Ivy,1,Tamera Ivy that's what we do with any other illness ?  What's different now?

I know people who aren‚Äôt being tested (even with symptoms or having been exposed) due to the stigma surrounding covid... people who won‚Äôt get tested because if they test positive they would have to stay home from work... people who won‚Äôt test their kids because they might miss a sporting event... people who have been exposed and knowingly continue to expose others because they just don‚Äôt care.

If I do get tested for any reason, I need to stay at home and remain isolated until I get the results back and then reevaluate. If I have symptoms or I have a close contact that has turned up sick or tested positive, then it's a great idea for me to get tested, but I do my best not to be around anyone for more than 30 seconds, I wear a mask 8 to 10 hours plus a day and I live alone. Yes it is possible that I could catch it. It's not very likely.

By taking the test voluntarily, allows now for the State DOH to enforce the laws on the books, this is what SB3 and SB4 and HB1046 and many others are all about. The ""Contact Tracing"" is building a database of known carriers and would be carriers of whom will now be put into a ""Program"" which will be managed and controlled by the ""BOARD"" made up of Health Professionals, whom now have broad powers to manage the population thru this pandemic, of whom also now get to report ""YOU"" if they feel you pose a threat to public safety. SDCL 34-22-18.1 which SB3 will if passed will remove the ""sunset"" which makes it permanent, allowing the ""DOH"" to enforce by orders, the recommendations of the ""BOARD"".  This board may see you as a threat if you do not follow or comply with the CDC guidlines such as Masks, 6 Feet Social Distancing Rules, Business Restrictions, or such as the Chamber Of Commerce rule of ""Patronizing"" only those businesses whom comply, or where you do not wear a mask or follow rules of hospitals, you will be reported to the Board, whom then uses the DOH to enforce such rules by directive.   The DOH also says they removed the word ""forced vaccines"" from the law; however they stress ""Medical Treatment"" which is a broad term that means -  ""the management and care of a patient to combat disease or disorder. Medical treatment includes: All treatment not otherwise excluded (below). Using prescription medications, or use of a non-prescription drug at prescription strength.""   its a form of legalese that can fully trick the people into complying, but lets face it, those vaccines are a form of medical treatment.   I am 100% support of State Rights, and the right of the people to self govern themselves, but we also got to be honest with people."

In California, a state that has a much higher density population with many large cities, the death rate is about 1 out of 1,334 residents, less than half of South Dakota so yeah it‚Äôs actually worse than many of us could imagine!  On a related note why is it when it comes to a woman‚Äôs right to choose, according to anti-choicers‚Äô arguments, economics can never be a consideration in what a woman may do with her own body?   Yet when it comes to COVID-19, with health and life and death issues that involve fully developed human beings, the economics of opening businesses prematurely or with few safety restrictions can take precedence during a deadly pandemic?  Seems like a double standard."

775,3529264190485250,Art-icle Aayy,ROOT,0,"A research paper published on November 20th highlights a case study of almost 10 million people in China.  What the study found was there were 300 cases of Coronavirus in the population being carried without any symptoms at all.  So the scientists then tracked the asymptomatic carriers.  The contact tracing of 1,174 ‚Äúclose contacts‚Äù with the asymptomatic carriers showed ZERO transmission.  Not a few, not a couple, but zero -none-  not a single transmission of Coronavirus from a person without symptoms.  The conclusion is not that asymptomatic spread is rare or that the science is uncertain. The study revealed something that hardly ever happens in these kinds of studies. There was not one documented case. Forget rare. Forget even Fauci‚Äôs previous suggestion that asymptomatic transmission exists but not does drive the spread. Replace all that with: never. At least not in this study for 10,000,000.  [STUDY] ‚Ä¶ Stringent COVID-19 control measures were imposed in Wuhan between January 23 and April 8, 2020. Estimates of the prevalence of infection following the release of restrictions could inform post-lockdown pandemic management. Here, we describe a city-wide SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening programme between May 14 and June 1, 2020 in Wuhan. All city residents aged six years or older were eligible and 9,899,828 (92.9%) participated.  No new symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI 0.270‚Äì0.339/10,000) were identified. There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases. 107 of 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19 patients tested positive again (re-positive rate 0.31%, 95% CI 0.423‚Äì0.574%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan was therefore very low five to eight weeks after the end of lockdown.  One might suppose that this would be huge news. It would allow us to open up everything immediately. With the whole basis for post-curve-flattening lockdowns crumbled, we could go back to living a normal life. The fear could evaporate. We could take comfort in our normal intuition that healthy people can get out and about with no risk to others. We could take off our masks. We could go to movies and sports events.  ‚Ä¶ We keep hearing about how we should follow the science. The claim is tired by now. We know what‚Äôs really happening. The lockdown lobby ignores whatever contradicts their narrative, preferring unverified anecdotes over an actual scientific study of 10 million residents in what was the world‚Äôs first major hotspot for the disease we are trying to manage. You would expect this study to be massive international news. So far as I can tell, it is being ignored. [More]  In essence, what the study of 10 million people confirmed is what many people, doctors, scientists and World Health Organization already suspected.  Like the common cold and flu when a person is infected with the virus they are only infecting others when they have symptoms: cold, runny nose, coughing, aching, sneezing, fever, congestion etc; hence, when a person has an illness they should isolate to not spread the virus. However, when a person has no external symptoms of the virus, just like the cold and flu, they are not a risk of transmitting the virus to others.  ‚ô¶ This is a major issue with massive ramifications because all of the current COVID-19 mitigation effort is based on the principle that people can carry and spread the virus while having no idea they have it, and no symptoms.  If asymptomatic transmission is not happening, and it appears with scientific certainty it is not, then all of the current lock-down regulations, mask wearing requirements and social distancing rules/decrees are based on a complete fallacy of false assumptions.  The asymptomatic case study published in November affirms the earlier reporting from the World Health Organization that COVID-19 is only known to transmit from people who are showing symptoms of the virus.  In June of 2020, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization‚Äôs emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said transmission of the coronavirus by people who aren‚Äôt showing symptoms is ‚Äúvery rare.‚Äù As you can see from the video explanation, in June 2020 Ms. Kerkhove could not identify a single study or case that was traced to asymptomatic spread; but scientists still thought it might be possible so she -and others- kept using the ‚Äúvery rare‚Äù terminology.  However, with the latest information and a far more lengthy timeline to study the disease, the cumulative 2020 data shows ‚Äúvery rare‚Äù actually means ‚Äúnever‚Äù, asymptomatic spread just doesn‚Äôt happen ‚Äì EVER.  So why is the entire world engaged in COVID-19 mitigation processes to block the transmission of a virus that has never, not even once, been identified as occurring?  https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2020/12/20/covid-19-study-of-almost-ten-million-finds-no-evidence-of-asymptomatic-spread-media-quiet/  https://www.aier.org/article/asymptomatic-spread-revisited/  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w"

Testing has decreased significantly (by 31% according to the last report I saw) and our daily positivity rates have increased.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force has also issued reports, and according to them we are not doing enough testing. In fact, SD is currently 47th in testing (per capita) out of 50 states."
944,3517100841701585,Kent Staubus,Walter Keith,1,Walter Keith The day to day rate will bounce up and down for a variety of reasons.  That's why the 7 day running average is what I look at.
945,3517100841701585,Allison Murphy,ROOT,0,SD has done less testing than Puerto Rico!!!   SD IS 47Th  in testing!  STOP MANIPULATING THE NUMBERS by purposely doing less testing. WHITE HOUSE recommends more testing!!  31% LESS testing this month!  STOP LYING!!
946,3517100841701585,Jordan Davis,Allison Murphy,1,Allison Murphy have you considered less testing is because of the large majority has been tested ? And the vaccines coming out

950,3517100841701585,Jordan Davis,Jason Ferguson,1,"Jason Ferguson I can‚Äôt share the photo from the national tracking website but one thing about having a lower population is less people to get infected. About 360,000 people have gotten tested which is a good chunk of our state. Then over 700,000 test have been analyzed assuming individuals being tested numerous times at hospitals and nursing homes.  Again large percentage of the state has been tested. So if it is slowing down it would most likely indicate positive cases have decreased for that reason.   https://covidtracking.com/data/state/south-dakota/tests-viral"

958,3517100841701585,Kent Staubus,Michael Black,1,The curve just might stay down.  Vaccine numbers will be kicking in during the coming weeks.  Once the >80 crowd is vaccinated the death rate will plummet.  I look for that to start the end of January.
959,3517100841701585,Michael Black,Michael Black,1,Matt Konrady We are having improvement as time goes on. It appears that we have peaked. I prefer having 500 new cases to 2000 new cases.

966,3517100841701585,Robert Friedrichsen,Denise Ayres,1,"Denise Ayres Yes, both of those are factually correct.  Masks do not prevent the spread -- they do slow the rate of increase of transmission.  The other study that cloth face masks do not work as well as N95 is also correct.  And particles will penetrate a cloth mask at a higher rate, but they also do not travel as far -- hence the guidance to use cloth masks when social distancing is not an option.  Like the winter wind in SD -- on bare skin it is frigid.  Put on a scarf and it slows down the cold wind hitting your face."

In some studies masks do not demonstrate they slow the rate of spread.  Some studies show a significant increase in resp illness in those that wear masks.  All I stress is individuals have inherent rights that must be protected.  Bodily autonomy must be protected.  Masks may just be the place holder for biologics as the logic for mandating is eerily similar."

975,3517100841701585,Denise Ayres,Robert Friedrichsen,0,Robert Friedrichsen  Is there a study to go with your article? I would like to see it the actual study that produced those numbers.  I have seen case numbers continue to rise even in States and counties that have enacted mask mandates and mask compliance is extremely high.  I have also seen several studies that say masks do not significantly decrease transmission if at all.  I am interested to see if there is a study to support the numbers in that article.
976,3517100841701585,Torey Walker,Denise Ayres,0,"Denise Ayres but,but, it was on the news and they never make stuff up..."
977,3517100841701585,Robert Friedrichsen,Denise Ayres,1,"Denise Ayres I do not have access to her data; however, it does seem to correlate to this study.  Using an event study that examined daily changes in county-level COVID-19 growth rates, the study found that mandating public use of face masks was associated with a reduction in the COVID-19 daily growth rate. Specifically, we found that the average daily county-level growth rate decreases by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1‚Äì5, 6‚Äì10, 11‚Äì15, 16‚Äì20, and 21 or more days after signing, respectively.  While a 2% daily reduction in the growth rate of positivity does not seem like much at first; it is the compounding effect that makes the difference.  For example, day 1 has 100 infections in anti-mask & 98 in pro-mask.  Day 2 100 vs 96, day 3 100 vs 94... and so on.  Basically, using masks does slow the rate of increase of transmission of covid. https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818"

1005,3514894941922175,Erika May,Kathy Jo Lembcke,1,"Kathy Jo Lembcke Of course. I don‚Äôt have a problem with posting about food safety. My problem is that THIS is the only holiday related post we are seeing from our own DOH in the middle of a respiratory pandemic where we KNOW gathering in groups, especially inside, greatly contributes to the spread of COVID."

1008,3514894941922175,Johanna Epps,ROOT,0,"Dear Health Department, To serve foods safely this year we need to do more than keep hot things hot etc.  Eating and drinking indoors with people who don't live in our households is one of the Covid riskiest things to do. You can lower the risk by keeping gatherings small, social distance, etc.  Where is your advice to the public about how to stay safe during this holiday season?"

Also kind of ironic that the numbers are supposedly going down when a vaccine is mentioned. Gotta keep sticking with the script right? It also creates a false sense of security. A lot of us have had our doubts since Noem decided to showboat our state and it's people.

1121,3514578035287199,Donny Weiand,Allison Murphy,1,"Allison Murphy the nations  you mentioned were able to close their borders. Half of them are islands so they can control access. And those countries also control what information passes from their borders. When Trump tried to close our borders the demo-rats squealed. Noem‚Äôs response was not an overreaction like many others and the economies of those states have suffered. Thank God! Look now at the well-being of the people from those states are suffering because of lockdowns. Was it worth it?   It sucks people have died but that is out of our control. The best science and medicine cannot irradiate cancer or even the seasonal flu.  The CDC claims that most have died with covid had underlying conditions from other diseases, old age and even from poor life and health decisions. Why should the lives of living and the heathy have to be restricted for a virus with a 99% survival rate?  Why should we tank our economy and destroy the livelihoods of others over this? A lot of us have to work and provide for our families.    I admire how Noem left the decision making power with the people to manage their lives and health decisions. As it should be. Why do you feel that it is the government‚Äôs responsibility to dictate what you and I do when there is 99% survival rate? How long before ‚Äúthey‚Äùdecide what and when we should receive healthcare?  Or how long you and I are permitted to live?   As for masks and face coverings, we are wearing them to make people feel safe. Yes, they retain your snot from coughs and sneezes but not the vapor sized particles from your breath which pass through them.  Again you are obsessed with testing. How much testing should we do? How often should we best tested? I suppose you will jump right on the band wagon when the government requires mandatory vaccinations and ‚Äúpapers‚Äù to travel in our own communities as well.  No thank you.   You also accuse DOH and the governor‚Äôs office of manipulating the numbers. Prove it! without How would the state government benefit from that if it were true?   Your obsession and stress over this virus is going to kill you before this virus will. If you are at risk stay home and protect yourself."

1197,3512098082201861,Paige Spilles,Amber Lynne Smith,1,You get tested even if you don‚Äôt feel sick bc you may be infected and asymptomatic and still spreading. Many states are testing people regularly regardless of how they feel. My friend‚Äôs college aged kids in Boston are required to get tested 2-3 times a week. That way they can immediately identify an infection and isolate that person before it spreads. Test-isolate-contact trace- repeat.
1198,3512098082201861,Nikki Mundekis,Merit Ahrendt,0,Merit Ahrendt  what about the fact we keep running out of tests? Not all that need tests are getting tested again. Also our monitoring testing (routine testing of medical staff for example) is much lower than most other states even when adjusted for population difference. 
1199,3512098082201861,Merit Ahrendt,Nikki Mundekis,1,Nikki Mundekis where are we running out of tests? What locations? 
1200,3512098082201861,Merit Ahrendt,Paige Spilles,1,Paige Spilles not true. Asymptomatic folks dont spread it.  People with symptoms spread it. 
1201,3512098082201861,Nikki Mundekis,Merit Ahrendt,0,Merit Ahrendt  surely you don‚Äôt understand how medical supplies work right now then. I don‚Äôt have to know the locations to know we are running out of tests as we have run out before every time the numbers did this. The numbers show it too and explaining testing to non medical personnel‚Äôs difficult. Also the guidelines for highly contagious disease processes is different than that of mildly contagious. Once you break a given percentage the community is considered at higher risk of poor outcomes.

1226,3512098082201861,Nikki Mundekis,Merit Ahrendt,0,Merit Ahrendt  the average person on here not understanding what a positivity rate should be and how it a positively rate normally looks for most diseases. Misinterpretation is simply misreading due to a lack of understanding. Our testing supply has been cut off again so that has made the numbers artificially drop.  But the positivity rate shows that enough tests are not being done. 
1227,3512098082201861,John Smith,Clark Stone,1,"Clark Stone I too like to look at this in terms of numbers. Weird stat of the day. We have lost 1300 people to Covid, which also happens to be the exact same amount we lose to smoking each year. Or to use your language, One in every 676 South Dakotans has been killed by the ""smoking"". It doesn't seem to gin up the same response though does it? But then again 60,000 flu deaths' per year didn't gin up a response either. Genuinely curious why the difference in peoples responses? I have my theories but curious what others think.       https://doh.sd.gov/documents/DashboardSmoking.pdf"
1228,3512098082201861,John Smith,Nikki Mundekis,1,Nikki Mundekis With your theory how would you explain the dropping hospitalizations and deaths? Schools are doing rapid spit tests now so it seems to me tests are more widely available than previously. 
1229,3512098082201861,Merit Ahrendt,Tamera Ivy,1,Tamera Ivy like I said.. plenty of testing where I am so much so IHS are letting the white man come get tested... it's all bout those benjamin's.. 
1230,3512098082201861,Nikki Mundekis,John Smith,0,John Smith  then why has our total per day average numbered tests gone down? The other two not dropping at the same relative rate either in fact they are still quite higher. 
1231,3512098082201861,John Smith,Nikki Mundekis,0,"Nikki Mundekis If we have less total active cases wouldn't less people be seeking testing? Also wouldn't you expect hospitalizations and deaths to be lagging indicators? They would not track exactly because they occur over different time frames. Example, you are mildly sick for 2 days or in the hospital three weeks."
1232,3512098082201861,Tamera Ivy,Merit Ahrendt,0,Merit Ahrendt plenty of testing where YOU are doesn‚Äôt equal plenty of testing statewide.

Thank goodness I haven't caught it yet. But. ill let you all know if I have an extra eyeball on Monday ü§£ if that's what you're worried about, and oh, I served my country and received many vaccines, and I'm still here!"

1348,3509406102471059,Karen Stanley Scarborough,Reva Pourier-Bad Wound,1,"Reva Pourier-Bad Wound Thank you for your service to this country and working in health care and caring for others.  Also I appreciate your post.  When I think of what our veterans have given this country, getting a vaccine to help safeguard our community and country and myself is not a difficult decision.  No one should be forced to get a vaccine but with all the advances in the medical field and all the scientists working on this it shouldn't take as long to develop as the vaccines 50 years ago.  We have freedoms and rights but we have responsibilities to care for each other too.  Please become more educated and less paranoid."
1349,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,ROOT,0,There have 2 cases i believe where the person had serious side effect from the vaccine.  I know one was a nurse in Canada and got the shot and a short tile later she went into anphlactic shock.and had to hospitalized.  I believe it was the vaccine from Pfizer.  I am not taking this vaccine at all.

1351,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Eric Johnson,0,"Eric Johnson that is very true, you would have to sue the federal government.  Because that's their security for making this vaccine.   And really she must be in with the big pharmaceutical company's to have that much proganda."
1352,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine because you will never ever change my mind.

1354,3509406102471059,Scott R. Brown,Sherrie Barnes,1,Sherrie Barnes do you get a flu shot every year? Without a clinical trial? 
1355,3509406102471059,Ellen Jouwstra,Sherrie Barnes,1,Sherrie Barnes trust science.  Get Facts.!  Are you really a nurse?? And do not trust science??? Hope you are never my nurse
1356,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Scott R. Brown,0,Scott R. Brown no I do not take that shot and have not for over 20 years
1357,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Ellen Jouwstra,0,"Ellen Jouwstra tmthat the food thing if I was your nurse you would have never know.  Science takes time to look at all sides of a question.  I don't believe that we have ever made a vaccine for a illness that has like a 97% survival rate.  What facts that big pharmaceutical companies, hide their data that makes their new drug.look bad.  It's all about money, the doctors get kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies if they promote their  drug.  I have witness this.  No I have no trust in them."
1358,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Ellen Jouwstra,0,"Ellen Jouwstra yes I really am a nurse, what because I have a different view than you, I'm to a lesser opinion than your. I trust vaccine that have been fully test.  And yes √†ll injections and medications have side effect.  But few have serious side effect of bell palsy, anphophflatic shock.  You would never know if i was your nurse, so keep guess.  Propganda is just that, a way for people to get you to do what they want you to do with out thinking for your selves."
1359,3509406102471059,Jolene Alvarez,Eric Johnson,0,Eric Johnson yea they came out with a vaccine in less than a year for a virus that has a 99% recovery rate but cancer has been around for how many years and they can‚Äôt make a vaccine for that ?? Hmmmmm
1360,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine take your opinion and put it on your pocket no one cares about your opinion.  Since you are surely inflator of the vaccine.  
1361,3509406102471059,Rhianna Cantine,Sherrie Barnes,1,"Sherrie Barnes  haha well thanks for the advice, but you‚Äôre the last person I‚Äôd take it from üòÇ"
1362,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine you don't speak for everyone.  People can make up their own minds. Many different people can come to the same conclusions.   I understood just fine. Your moms the nurse not you.  So your opinion really does not carry any weight with me.  
1363,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine go back to the front page and see just how many people are not taking this vaccine. And what I said is true.  Your just pissy because you don't like our decision.
1364,3509406102471059,Eric Johnson,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine maybe they should do more research before saying it's safe for humans. Most new vaccines take 5-10 years to be available to the public
1365,3509406102471059,Rhianna Cantine,Eric Johnson,1,"Eric Johnson All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development  or being distributed are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you‚Äôll get COVID-19. Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases and early data from clinical trials, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine may also help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Experts continue to conduct more studies about the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on severity of illness from COVID-19, as well as its ability to keep people from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.  This is straight from the CDC website, I think I‚Äôm going to believe this and trust this. I do think it‚Äôs interesting with how fast they found a vaccine, but it has been a year now. I don‚Äôt know everything and that‚Äôs not the point of why I‚Äôve been commenting, I‚Äôm just saying I really hope this vaccine works because  everyone wants to get back to their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lives. This pandemic has also caused suicides and mental illness to increase, which is terrible sad. For now I‚Äôm going to believe the CDC and the healthcare workers and hope and pray for the best v"
1366,3509406102471059,Eric Johnson,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine OK but from what I've heard you have to sign a waiver so you can't hold the manufacturer liable for any long term side affects that makes me feel like there pouting this out way too fast
1367,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine I would never listen to a word coming of your mouth.  You sure must be one who thinks that there's an answer to every problem.  Well even with the best intentions some problems have an answer that may not be the best.  And this virus vaccine is it.  The uk is already having a more virgous mutation of this virus.  Who knows if this vaccine will be effective on a virus that mutated.  Besides there's a 97 % survival rate.
1368,3509406102471059,Rhianna Cantine,Sherrie Barnes,1,"Sherrie Barnes  thank you Ms. Barnes. You really don‚Äôt know me at all, so please stop assuming things about me. I stopped commenting back at your messages last night when I realized I have better things to do like spend time with my family and get off of Facebook! Nice chatting with you! Hope you have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"
1369,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,"Rhianna Cantine yep, she must be in cahoots with the big pharmaceutical companies to spew such crap."
1370,3509406102471059,Rhianna Cantine,Sherrie Barnes,1,Sherrie Barnes everyone has different reactions to everything. Maybe you should do more research before you say you won‚Äôt get the vaccine instead of jumping to conclusions. 
1371,3509406102471059,Scott T Lee,Sherrie Barnes,1,"2 out of 130,000 people who got vaccinated experienced severe allergic reactions (and survived). What baffles me is that the people who complain that is too much risk are the same people that think 1 out of 100 people dying of the disease isn't that bad."
1372,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,"Rhianna Cantine I am a nurse and I am in control of what I put in my body.  I will not put a vaccine that has not be tested enough into my body. That is my right. Being a.nurse I know that people have different reactions but really anphlactic shock,a nurse in Canada did and they had to admit her to the hospital.  So don't tell me this vaccine is safe."
1373,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Scott T Lee,0,"Scott T Lee people die every day and in every way. The truth is you live you die.  There is no miracle cure for death.  It amazes me that if not everyone agrees with your opinion their the problem.  NO we who decide not to take is vaccine have the right not to take it for various reason.  Just like people have various reasons they want to take it.   I for one am not afraid of my fate.  If I get the covid then I get it, with a survival rate of what some thing like 97% i will take my chances."
1374,3509406102471059,Rhianna Cantine,Sherrie Barnes,1,"Sherrie Barnes yeah my mom is a nurse so I know some things too. I know everyone has their rights and you can choose, but I wouldn‚Äôt just put it out of my mind to get the vaccine just because of a couple bad stories that could be misinterpreted by so many different people. "
1375,3509406102471059,Sherrie Barnes,Rhianna Cantine,0,Rhianna Cantine that the difference between you and me i say what I mean. Well I made my.mind up way before the vaccine was even released.  Misinterpreted not really I said I will not be taking this vaccine. No way of misinterpreted that statement.  So move along.
1376,3509406102471059,Rhianna Cantine,Sherrie Barnes,1,"Sherrie Barnes yeah you can‚Äôt even understand what I write üòÇüòÇ I meant everyone, not just you. That‚Äôs why I said many different people. Maybe you should move on from hearing a couple bad stories and then going to write about it on Facebook. So move along. "

I didn't feel like myself until this year in October or so, I wonder if had the virus.  I will get the shots to be sure there is nothing in them but sugars and salts and the RNA factor, it can't be any worse than the heart medications they pushed on me."

1380,3509406102471059,Fred Stands,Schuyler Hamilton,0,Schuyler Hamilton even if you get the shot you still have to wear your mask.
1381,3509406102471059,Shane Hammer,Schuyler Hamilton,1,Schuyler Hamilton so let me get this straight you want to wear a mask all the time for the foreseeable future. If that's the case move to china they have been wearing them for years.
1382,3509406102471059,Schuyler Hamilton,Shane Hammer,0,"Shane Hammer ,you didn't catch my sarcasm.  I was told, you won't get it, if you wear a mask. Lol I won't be doing either. "

1399,3509406102471059,Kelsey Schilling,Michael Mornard,1,Michael Mornard does the vaccine prevent the person from contracting covid? Does the vaccine prevent the person from transmitting covid? The answer is no to both those questions so why should people get the vaccine?

1404,3509406102471059,Stacey Eddy,Michael Mornard,0,Michael Mornard why would you inject yourself with an unproven technology?  There are much safer and proven solutions if you do your research. Take a look at what they are using in third world countries. It‚Äôs safer proven and it works for about .01% of the cost
1405,3509406102471059,Michael Mornard,Michael Mornard,1,Weekly World News is not research.

She got the vaccine. 36 hours later she was as sick as a dog. She almost had to be rushed to the ER. Her tongue turned black. Like literally black, as black as a tire. It took a week for the color to go away and she still doesn't feel like her old self. For a virus with a 99.98% survival rate, I'll trust my immune system over poison from big pharma that's can't be sued for side effects. Oh and another nurse developed bells palsy. Not worth the risk."

1411,3509406102471059,La Var Wherry,Rhianna Cantine,0,"Rhianna Cantine that‚Äôs not what they have been saying. They said people with underlying conditions were unable to receive it. At any time, and that is why it is so important everyone else gets vaccinated. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Someone that has been vaccinated can still spread/carry it. "
1412,3509406102471059,Linsey Johnson,La Var Wherry,1,"you then, were misinformed. After healthcare workers, those high risk will be eligible for vaccination before the public.

You treat people like complete trash and don't even realize it, and you're trying to judge me for standing up for them? GTFOOH. And grow the hell up. Just because you are behind your screen doesn't make this any less real. And your actions will have consequences one day. You better search your soul and ask if this is really the reputation you want to be making for yourself.

Secondly, it's funny that you are calling me the problem when I help run a group with almost 10,000 members who are all much smarter than you, by miles and miles. No dude. I am not the problem. I have an education and common sense. I put both of them to work every single day and do what I have to do to keep myself and my family safe. Because that is what a REAL man does. And I'll stand up for it every single day of the week and some dolt on Facebook who apparently doesn't understand how it works, isn't going to change anything... But hey, if being a sheep and falling in line with the other morons who don't understand basic epidemiology works for you, then have fun with that."

My friend laid in a hospital in Salt Lake for six weeks with strokes from blood clots and lost both of her kidneys.  She is now on dialysis for the rest of her life.  Do you think she feels like a survivor?  Not the way she and her husband planned on spending their retirement years down the road instead of traveling.   She is one example of a ""long-hauler"" and there are many who ""survive"" but don't get their quality of life back.   Recovered means their symptoms have lessened and they are no longer infectious. It doesn't mean they are no longer feeling the effects of COVID-19."
1710,3509410815803921,Laurie Lienhard,Vicki Drake- Peterson,0,"Vicki Drake- Peterson this was sent out from a group of doctors-  ‚ÄúI have a PhD in virology and immunology. I'm a clinical lab scientist and have tested 1500 ""supposed"" positive Covid 19 samples collected here in S. California. When my lab team and I did the testing through Koch's postulates and observation under a SEM (scanning electron microscope), we found NO Covid in any of the 1500 samples. What we found was that all of the 1500 samples were mostly Influenza A and some were influenza B, but not a single case of Covid, and we did not use the B.S. PCR test. We then sent the remainder of the samples to Stanford, Cornell, and a few of the University of California labs and they found the same results as we did, NO COVID. They found influenza A and B. All of us then spoke to the CDC and asked for viable samples of COVID, which CDC said they could not provide as they did not have any samples. We have now come to the firm conclusion through all our research and lab work, that the COVID 19 was imaginary and fictitious. The flu was called Covid and most of the 225,000 dead were dead through co-morbidities such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, emphysema etc. and they then got the flu which further weakened their immune system and they died. I have yet to find a single viable sample of Covid 19 to work with. We at the 7 universities that did the lab tests on these 1500 samples are now suing the CDC for Covid 19 fraud. the CDC has yet to send us a single viable, isolated and purifed sample of Covid 19. If they can't or won't send us a viable sample, I say there is no Covid 19, it is fictitious. The four research papers that do describe the genomic extracts of the Covid 19 virus never were successful in isolating and purifying the samples. All the four papers written on Covid 19 only describe small bits of RNA which were only 37 to 40 base pairs long which is NOT A VIRUS. A viral genome is typically 30,000 to 40,000 base pairs. With as bad as Covid is supposed to be all over the place, how come no one in any lab world wide has ever isolated and purified this virus in its entirety? That's because they've never really found the virus, all they've ever found was small pieces of RNA which were never identified as the virus anyway. So what we're dealing with is just another flu strain like every year, COVID 19 does not exist and is fictitious. I believe China and the globalists orchestrated this COVID hoax (the flu disguised as a novel virus) to bring in global tyranny and a worldwide police totalitarian surveillance state, and this plot included massive election fraud.‚Äù"

In case you are unfamiliar with how a peer review works, a study is done and a hypothesis is made. Then several scientists repeat that study step for step in an attempt to prove and disprove the hypothesis. Once they repeat the study and prove or disprove it, the initial study has been peer reviewed and the results are published as proven or disproven. In this case one of the two vaccines studies proved not to work or be the safest, so they continued the second study with the other one which proved to work and was overall safe.  I realize it is hard for someone without a background in biology and chemistry to understand peer reviewed studies and they are difficult to read, so I hope I put it in a simpler way to understand for anyone who is trying to read the studies.

You can find South Dakota's numbers on the State Health Dept website.  You can look at September and October and see the increase in deaths from last year to this year.

We are extremely short staffed. I know health care providers working in some of these hospitals so I get first hand reports as well as official state reports that are available.  In terms of your 99.99x% number, I have no idea where you get that from.  In South Dakota you have already had .11% of your population die with Covid and only about 10% or so of your population has been infected so far.

However, if you look at the data for September and October when SoDak started to experience the surge, these are the numbers (Again it is scaled to deaths per 100,000 population so to get it to the actual numbers you would have to multiply by 9 because you have about 900,000 people.) September: 686 vs. September 2020: 751  And October 2019:686  vs   October 2020:937  November and December 2020 have not been reported yet.

1819,3509410815803921,Sapphire Franke,Sasha Joy,1,"Sasha Joy   That‚Äôs not how it works.   There are many factors that you‚Äôre neglecting when accounting for these numbers.   - Not everyone who dies gets an obituary released or published. This is ESPECIALLY true this year, for obvious reasons.   - Obituary publications nationwide are consistently decreasing year by year, albeit 2020 is an anomaly that can‚Äôt even be considered in that trend. You can do your own research on this.  - You can‚Äôt take incomprehensive data from 3 popular funeral homes and learn much of anything. There are dozens of funeral homes in the Black Hills.  - People don‚Äôt get obits published where they die, they get them published where they‚Äôre from.   Something else to consider is that the effects of Covid-19 are FAR more complex than mortality. We have data that shows permanent damage to every vital organ in the body. Many people‚Äôs cardiovascular systems are permanently damaged. Some people are getting their limbs amputated, erectile dysfunction, hair loss, etc.    You can thank those of us who take the virus seriously that the numbers are not far worse. I‚Äôm not surprised to see you‚Äôre a business owner, you all seem to care more about money than lives.   Your other CDC link tells you everything. +1,166 deaths this year and +40% increase in deaths the past 2 months compared to last year."

What is the healthcare system gonna do when 30 percent or more of their ""essential"" staff is out of work due to vaccine adverse rxns?!  Man this could get real bad.  Also, is the hospital gonna pay the employees' lawsuit for the injury since they forced them to take it?  I hope so, since the drug companies are off the hook.  More senseless suffering. So sad."

They do not know if a vaccine will develop the herd immunity that is sought after -- they do not know if a vaccinated person can still transmit the virus.  That is why they are recommending that people still wear a mask, even after their 2nd shot."

2026,3499823163429353,Terri Williams Murray,Torey Walker,1,"Torey Walker  From www.who.int ‚ÄòWhile the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) may be  slightly lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%.   From John Hopkins:  COVID-19: There have been approximately 1,584,788 deaths reported worldwide. In the U.S, 292,195 people have died of COVID-19 between January 2020 and December 11, 2020.* Flu: The World Health Organization estimates that 290,000 to 650,000 people die of flu-related causes every year worldwide. The COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly. Since this disease is caused by a new virus, the vast majority of people do not yet have immunity to it, and a vaccine may be many months away. Doctors and scientists are working to estimate the mortality rate of COVID-19, but at present, it is thought to be substantially higher (possibly 10 times or more) than that of most strains of the flu. *This information comes from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering."

Doesnt appear to be doing any better than SD unless you count the number of businesses that are closed and lives ruined because of it.

But I do see the issue with them not being the best idea. However a state wide mask mandate and not spending our COVID funds for a tourist campaign would have been nice. Encouraging all these people to move here after the census is over will hurt us. Have you seen the people that are moving here? A lot are homeschooling kids w special needs.

The multiplier might be between 3-5 so as many as one-half (prob NOT really that many) of SD residents may have some degree of post-infection immunity. This is speculation, of course, but with a strong scientific basis."
2156,3497322463679423,Tamera Ivy,Jim Buchanan,0,"Jim Buchanan, I based my comment on confirmed cases, but you‚Äôre absolutely right. Test positivity rates, on top of the fact that plenty of people are either denied testing, or refusing to be tested indicates that far more have (or have had) covid than has been reported.  I got off track with that comment.  My point is that people are being reinfected, and I don‚Äôt think herd immunity has been achieved anywhere at this point. "

When I do comment it is now fully expected that Any comment I do make will be ripped apart and twisted to fit the agenda of those who are unable to see the good in anything when it comes to the virus.  I see how they jump all over anyone who might be the voice of good news.  The fact is that these numbers will continue to go up and go down and repeat.  But still the preaching continues (Wear that mask!!) even though I think we get that already.  And the blame game is always here too.  Before the day is up, someone will be calling the governor and president killers.  It‚Äôs really sad that people live to bash others opinions and won‚Äôt even consider the possibility of good news.  That is the majority of the commenters unfortunately.  Good news is never welcome in a negative environment.  This is definitely that. I will still check the hospitalization numbers because it seems maybe those are the only real ones that matter anyway as deaths while someone has covid are counted the same as died From covid.  Covid does not Always mean death.  Cases do not always mean death.  Either there is not enough testing or too much testing.  Every day it‚Äôs the same people and the same sad blame game and the same sad messages. Sad rules in here lately.  Social media can bring out the best at times and also the worst in people.  It gives people license to blame and complain and attack others.  I will leave that to all of you now and will no longer try to point out the good in things.

2323,3489920751086261,Johanna Epps,Johanna Epps,0,WHY ARE REPORTED TESTS DROPPING BY 26% SINCE LAST WEEK?
2324,3489920751086261,Alli Clarke Muilenburg,Johanna Epps,1,Johanna Epps because less people are requesting to be tested. Probably because less  people are sick. 
2325,3489920751086261,Johanna Epps,Alli Clarke Muilenburg,0,"Alli Clarke Muilenburg Do you know for sure that less people are requesting tests and I‚Äôd so I would like that info.  It‚Äôs my experience when test reporting drops like this, it means there is a log jam in the reporting system.  Also FYI, South Dakota currently has the highest death rate but one of the lowest test reporting rates.  ND is doing far more testing and has a much lower positivity rate."
2326,3489920751086261,Heidi Morgan,Johanna Epps,1,If less people were sick we wouldn‚Äôt have a 49.7% positivity rate.

Therefore, some of those persons go to work sick, or  take only  a few days off..... "
2328,3489920751086261,Alli Clarke Muilenburg,Johanna Epps,1,"It's just an assumption. As is the assumption that less tests are happening out of a willful desire to manipulate the numbers. I'm sure that there are plenty of mildly sick people that are not getting tested. I'm just saying, I don't think anyone is being turned down for a test. It's incredibly easy to get a test if you want one."

I know I‚Äôd be more likely to get tested if I didn‚Äôt have to drive 2 hours to get one. Make it free and widely available. Sometimes they won‚Äôt even test asymptotic people, maybe testing close contacts etc could help slow the spread. Like in schools, most kids probably aren‚Äôt going to have symptoms, randomly test students.  Colleges that have had the fewest cases had more testing, some colleges test all of their students."

2441,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,ROOT,1,"I have noticed all week now that the hospitalizations are steadily going down.  Still high but this is really good news, right? Of course I expect to be attacked by someone for pointing out possible good news.  I kinda like seeing this number drop."
2442,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Ann Holman,1,"Ann Holman but the State‚Äôs number of hospitalizations have been consistently dropping.  That is my point.  Sad to see ICU patients so high of course, but it looks like we may be headed in a better direction.  That was my point.  Hopefully most in ICU recover soon. That would also be good!"
2443,3482241141854222,Meghan Anderson Finch,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan absolutely! 
2444,3482241141854222,Kathy Gillman,Roger Schmaltz,1,Roger Schmaltz ok
2445,3482241141854222,Tree Jandreau,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan keep in mind that people are dying so that will drop the hospitalization numbers as well.
2446,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Tree Jandreau,1,Tree Jandreau umm yes
2447,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Roger Schmaltz,1,Roger Schmaltz that is only part of the equation.  There are also people who recover and get to go home.  Why do you not talk about that?
2448,3482241141854222,Barb Hardman,Carolyn Hammer,1,Carolyn Hammer they are being sent to Hospitals in Wyoming and Montana if those hospitals have staff. 
2449,3482241141854222,Robb Buskohl,Shondra Johnson,1,Shondra Johnson it was even on KELO this morning.. They said that Sanford is 100% full and Avera is 97% full...
2450,3482241141854222,Shondra Johnson,Kevin Ryan,1,I will believe someone who actually works in the hospital over Keloland news. They are as bad as some of the big name news. 
2451,3482241141854222,Michael Black,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan your employer will likely keep mask use in place of it reduces absentee rate from sickness. Public transportation and almost every large gathering of people might be expected to have everyone don a face covering for years to come. Insurance companies might dictate mask wearing as a condition of issuing coverage.  It won't be a choice. I hope that I am wrong but I think my logic is solid.
2452,3482241141854222,Jenny Gross,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan I noticed that same thing!!
2453,3482241141854222,Peggy Lynn Friedrich,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan the sad part,  it correspond with deaths.  The hospitals are jammed."
2454,3482241141854222,Roger Schmaltz,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan unfortunately it has alot to do with increasing death rates 
2455,3482241141854222,Roger Schmaltz,Kathy Gillman,1,Kathy Gillman except it is because the death rates are going up. Sadly
2456,3482241141854222,Terry Paverud,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan these aren‚Äôt the right numbers, the real numbers are all much worse."
2457,3482241141854222,Lea Dingman,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan  I am a former paramedic and have several friends who are still RN's in the Avera hospitals, and they say it's much worse than many are reporting.  KSFY did a story earlier this week with Dr.'s and Nurses here in SD.  They confirm that it is much worse than what you are seeing reported in the news or by Kristi Noem. One of my RN friends in Mitchell at QOP said she's been putting in doubles for weeks now.üò•"
2458,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Lea Dingman,1,Lea Dingman I feel for those working heroes and pray for them.  I was just pointing out that the hospitalization numbers have been steadily decreasing.  I still believe that might be good!
2459,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Meghan Anderson Finch,1,Meghan Anderson Finch yes Meghan.  I do believe in positive thoughts.  (Notice how I didn‚Äôt say pants?). I know better than that! I hope numbers keto going down to give the health care heroes a break.
2460,3482241141854222,Bonnie Henningson,Carolyn Hammer,1,"Carolyn Hammer yes, I believe that is true."
2461,3482241141854222,Heidi Morgan,Micki Warren Berg,1,Micki Warren Berg sad but true
2462,3482241141854222,Ann Holman,Carolyn Hammer,1,Carolyn Hammer I saw the same. I cannot remember where though. I know people that have been flown to ND and IA recently to get ICU care.

2465,3482241141854222,Johanna Epps,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan There are vaccines on the way  :-)
2466,3482241141854222,Micki Warren Berg,Kevin Ryan,1,"Andrejka Nc, according to your information nobody has received any of that money. It will be up to congress to send the money to states. It seems like a good deal of dollars but, a day in the ICU costs $50,000. Most of these people will be in ICU‚Äôs for weeks if not months, so it‚Äôs not much. They must pay for doctors at $500 per hour and nurses at $50 per hour along with other staff."
2467,3482241141854222,Meghan Anderson Finch,Kevin Ryan,1, Great news!! We need all the optimism we can‚Äôt get right now!

2469,3482241141854222,Laura Bies,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan it comes from a variety of factors but yeah, some of them are good news. Treatment has come a long ways since this started, people spend less time in the hospital thanks to new therapies.  Hope we continue to see it go in the right direction but the holiday gatherings worry me, will be awhile longer until we see how that affects it. "
2470,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Laura Bies,1,Laura Bies you are correct.  People needed to feel like humans again and some needed to see their loved ones.  Hopefully not huge spikes.  I love that some people also see the health benefits resulting from hugging their parents over Thanksgiving.  My parents are dead fairly recently from causes other than Covid.  I wish I could have hugged them last Thursday.  Life is not all about staying away from the people we love.
2471,3482241141854222,Patrick West,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin actually, SARS disappeared and has not reappeared, there is always hope. "
2472,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Patrick West,1,Patrick West I will always vote for hope.
2473,3482241141854222,Tamera Ivy,Shondra Johnson,0,Shondra Johnson https://www.sdnewswatch.org/stories/some-severe-covid-patients-flown-out-of-state-for-care-as-s-d-hospital-icu-capacity-dwindles/?fbclid=IwAR0FpnGmEi56hWWIWI5wyWF4qaJ_IwcwyMfHJmAGaQRzy23PhzhRgfitqs0
2474,3482241141854222,Laura Bies,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan, I was agreeing with you about the improvements. Unfortunately I feel we still need to social distance, that does not mean we are in the clear. I don‚Äôt get together with my family at the moment and I miss them. I also don‚Äôt judge people who are getting together with family, I‚Äôm jealous, personally I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs right at the moment. I can only control my own actions though. "
2475,3482241141854222,Michael Black,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan then you should expect to wear a mask and practice social distancing for years to come. The mask mandates are never going to go away unless we reach zero. 
2476,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Laura Bies,1,Laura Bies I agree.  We can only be responsible for ourselves.
2477,3482241141854222,Patrick West,Kevin Ryan,1,Michael google Jena Germany. Great article on how they reached ZERO. With masks üò∑ 
2478,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Michael Black,1,Michael Black I am not giving up my humanity forever.  Feel free to do that for yourself however. Until I feel the major threat has passed I will continue to do my part.  I expect you to do what you feel you need to do.  You should not expect me to do as you dictate to me.  Best wishes.
2479,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Geoff Bonvallet,1,"Geoff Bonvallet Also in that same article..In South Dakota, hospital critical-care capacity was limited long before COVID-19 hit. Rural residents in need of intensive care already were frequently expected to travel up to hundreds of miles by plane, helicopter or ambulance to get lifesaving treatment at major healthcare centers in Sioux Falls or Rapid City...Sounds like this is nothing new."
2480,3482241141854222,Amanda Jill,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan this isn't an attack...more of a pondering. With over 100 South Dakota deaths reported in the past week, wondering if that doesn't contribute a little to the lower hospitalizations.  It stands to reason that many deaths are occurring outside of the hospital (in LTC), but roughly half were in hospital.  Not sure if that decreases the hospitalizations, or at least contributes."
2481,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Kevin Ryan,1,Amanda Chaney of course.  But would you possibly consider that maybe some actually recovered?  There is that..Treatments are improving you know...
2482,3482241141854222,Michael Black,Kevin Ryan,1,Kevin Ryan we are a long way from zero. That's the goal.
2483,3482241141854222,Geoff Bonvallet,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan As I said, I make no endorsement of the article. You were asking what her source was and I figured I would be helpful."
2484,3482241141854222,Amanda Jill,Kevin Ryan,1,"Kevin Ryan absolutely agree with your statement. There are so many recoveries to be grateful for. I was just looking at today's data when I saw your comment.  Of the 31 deaths reported today, 17 were in hospital.   Of course those #'s lag because of days it takes to report a death, but pondering a contributing factor to watching the hospitalizations go down for the last week or two, along with high death counts."
2485,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Michael Black,1,Michael Black a very long way.  Zero is years and years away.  Maybe it is never attainable?  I think zero is completely unrealistic.
2486,3482241141854222,Micki Warren Berg,Kevin Ryan,0,"Kevin Ryan, it could be because they are dying."
2487,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Micki Warren Berg,1,Micki Warren Berg or some recovered also?  Of course some are dying.
2488,3482241141854222,Kevin Ryan,Geoff Bonvallet,1,Geoff Bonvallet thanks for being reasonable

2498,3482241141854222,Ann Holman,Rebecca Reddy,1,Rebecca Reddy is that why the hospital cases are down?
