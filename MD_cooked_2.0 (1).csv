0,291802599651461,Jenna Leigh Lucia,ROOT,0,"I waited in an hour+ long entrance line at the Baltimore Washington medical center ER. I was there for heart issues while nearly all the people in front of me were there to get a COVID test. I told one of the staff I was there for heart problems and asked if there was a separate line and was shocked when she said no.    If they are going to do these testing sites at hospitals I hope to God they get smart and start separating the lines AND the waiting areas! One for COVID testing, one for real emergencies! I have even more worry now after that experience for people with real life emergencies stuck standing in a line with a ton of people just waiting to get a test! Not to mention how that increases exposure unnecessarily to those who are not there for COVID."
1,291802599651461,Wen Cotter,Jenna Leigh Lucia,1,Jenna Leigh Lucia guess next time use an ambulance
2,291802599651461,Catherine Beck Shoup,Jenna Leigh Lucia,1,Jenna Leigh Lucia The testing was not at the ED at either site. The the emergency rooms in question experienced immediate relief due to these sites. I'm sorry for your experience.

4,291802599651461,Wen Cotter,Jenna Leigh Lucia,1,Jenna Leigh Lucia don't believe me
5,291802599651461,Jenna Leigh Lucia,Wen Cotter,0,"Wen Cotter Your comment is stupid really (I'm shocked someone liked it, but I suppose birds of a feather flock together), and I felt it deserved no further response than the gif I posted. But since you insist... No, I didn't want to pay the minimum $350 ambulance bill that often isn't covered by insurance when I live a minute from the ER and was capable of getting there on my own. Were you going to pay that bill for me?   Secondly, I felt it was an emergency enough to be evaluated at the ER (At my doctor's request), but not emergency enough to take away the precious resource of an ambulance for someone in more dire straights. I did not feel at that moment I was heaving a heart attack.  And lastly, your comment is dumb because it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual issue that I mentioned,  which was that they were funneling COVID testers and real emergencies into one ER walk in entrance line.  Believe it or not, people not needing an ambulance but still need to be seen at the ER walk in EVERY day). That problem doesn't just cease to exist for others despite whatever my personal choice of entrance was.   Do you have any other super ignorant words for me now Wen?"
6,291802599651461,Wen Cotter,Jenna Leigh Lucia,1,"Jenna Leigh Lucia as you state your choice of entrance....sad you don't want to pay the ambulance fees when you think you are having heart issues, since they would start an evaluation on you right then.  Didn't know use an ambulance are super ignorant words or don't believe me!"
7,291802599651461,Wen Cotter,Jenna Leigh Lucia,1,Jenna Leigh Lucia no drive thru at bank or home test...thanks for stopping...
8,291802599651461,Jenna Leigh Lucia,Catherine Beck Shoup,1,"Catherine Beck Shoup I don't think there's an issue with having a testing site near the emergency department, but I do think it's an issue that they don't have a separate entrance line. There should be a COVID testing line and then an emergencies only line. It didn't seem like an efficient way to do things. An old lady in front of me was having other issues too, not sure what, but we talked about how crazy it was that we had to wait in the same line with people just waiting for a test. (This was at UM Baltimore Washington, not sure about how other hospitals are doing it)"
9,291802599651461,Catherine Beck Shoup,Jenna Leigh Lucia,0,Jenna Leigh Lucia that does sound difficult
10,291802599651461,Joan Murray Bradley,ROOT,1,We need drive thru services.  Many are here because they are sick.  Old people have a hard time standing that long in the cold.  There needs to be more than 2!  Please and thank you!
11,291802599651461,Eileen Orndorff,Joan Murray Bradley,1,Joan Murray Bradley yes I agree .many seniors  can't stand that long especially with any type hip/knee problem
12,291802599651461,Yolanda Jones,ROOT,1,At Home Covid-19 test must be distributed to everyone that needs one. DC is having the fire department distribute to all DC residents with no problem. Please make this At-Home Test more available to all MD residents. I have to wait two weeks to get tested from Kaiser Permanente.
13,291802599651461,Jennifer Giron,Yolanda Jones,1,Yolanda Jones at home tests are not reliable tons of people are getting false negative results thinking they don't have it and then spreading it even more. So may help detect some cases but alot of times not working.
14,291802599651461,Melinda Evans,Yolanda Jones,1,Yolanda Jones that’s what has happened with 3 of my friends
15,291802599651461,Ellen Malloy Reich,Jennifer Giron,1,"Jennifer Giron Yes.... heard the at home ""antigen tests"" not so reliable.  The PCR tests given at test sites much more accurate!  It's getting appts that's problem."
16,291802599651461,Jennifer Giron,Ellen Malloy Reich,1,Ellen Malloy Reich yes has been issue for me as well finally got a Pcr test today
17,291802599651461,Saundra Hovermale Cline,Yolanda Jones,0,Yolanda Jones yes i agree. They are 25 for a test kit.
18,291802599651461,Saundra Hovermale Cline,Yolanda Jones,0,Yolanda Jones we should not have to pay for tests
19,291802599651461,Casey Delivuk,ROOT,0,A friend was there for 4 hours waiting. It’s a shame. At this point if you are sick just assume it’s Covid & stay home.
20,291802599651461,Shawn Willis-Frykberg,Casey Delivuk,1,"Casey Delivuk  , I think most people have to prove to their job whether they have it or not. Most jobs won't let you back till you test negative"
21,291802599651461,Casey Delivuk,Shawn Willis-Frykberg,1,Shawn Willis-Frykberg well there will be a lot of people not working
22,291802599651461,Shawn Willis-Frykberg,Casey Delivuk,1,"Casey Delivuk , im sure.."
23,291802599651461,Mae Holmes,Casey Delivuk,1,Casey Delivuk  good...stop the spread stay home..
24,291802599651461,Shawn Willis-Frykberg,Casey Delivuk,1,"Casey Delivuk , unfortunately there is a lot of people that can't afford to be out of work and getting that negative test result is important for them to be able to get back to work.  It sucks all over and any way you look at it. I just pray to God that I don't get it. My daughter has it, but is already feeling better. She has been staying in her room away from me.  And so far so good and knock on wood, cross my fingers and praying that I don't get it!"
25,291802599651461,LeRonda Perry,ROOT,0,I wish this was announced 8 hours ago! Spent 8 HOURS getting a COVID test. 😡😡😡

27,291802599651461,Michelle Douglas,ROOT,0,I spent 200.00 buying tests for my family. Something is just not right with this situation. Plus I waited for five hours at Patient First.
28,291802599651461,Maude L Franceschina,Michelle Douglas,1,Michelle Douglas why?
29,291802599651461,Dan Lawrence,Michelle Douglas,1,Oh my God! I got two at CVS in Silver Spring Last Monday for $10 each. FloFlex they are approved.
30,291802599651461,Susan Miller,ROOT,1,"Good news we need more testing. For those of us at high risk we also need rapid access to treatments. The only MAB that treats Omicron is out of stock, none of the infusion centers in MD have it. The new antiviral pills need to be started within days of getting a positive test and you must have a prescription. If you can't get a test you can't get the the prescription or the pill. Allow pharmacies to do rapid testing and supply the pill on the spot to those at high risk for severe Covid."
31,291802599651461,Kelly Phipps,ROOT,1,"""The sites are located at University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health in Bel Air and at Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis.

35,291802599651461,Shannon Malcolm,Judy L. Morris Hoffman,1,Judy L. Morris Hoffman We have a drive thru testing site in Allegany Co. (Western Maryland). Although I think they need to increase testing days to more than Mon Wed and Fri.
36,291802599651461,Judy L. Morris Hoffman,Shannon Malcolm,0,Shannon Malcolm we are in Washington Co. and the lines are enormous. The wait is between 4-6 hours.
37,291802599651461,Shannon Malcolm,Judy L. Morris Hoffman,1,Judy L. Morris Hoffman Wow. I went today and I waited about 20 mins. The line was long but they had it moving very fast.
38,291802599651461,Crystal Cook,ROOT,0,They have no problem giving shots and having enough but cannot keep up with testing? Smh. My husband is sick and needs to be tested for work and cannot find a place to do so. Even the at home tests at the store are sold out.
39,291802599651461,Patricia Turner Wyne,Crystal Cook,0,"In the same situation. It's so frustrating!!! Went to aamc yesterday. Having sick people wait in line for hours in a garage & outside is ridiculous. No restroom, seating, nothing to help them. We waited for the test for an hour, but had to give up..."

65,291802599651461,Susan Miller,Elizabeth Lee,1,"Elizabeth Lee Your 99.99% survival rate is wrong. According to John's Hopkins the case fatality rate in the US is 1.5%.  Older adults and those with comorbidities are at at much higher risk of death. Per the CDC, ""Compared with 18- to 29-year-olds, the rate of death is four times higher in 30- to 39-year-olds, and 370 times higher in those who are 85 years and older"". According to the article I have linked below: ""All other causes of death pale in comparison to the coronavirus death toll. So far, the coronavirus has killed roughly three times as many people as accidents, lung ailments, stroke or Alzheimer’s disease did in 2019. And the coronavirus has outpaced the number of deaths from diabetes, kidney disease, pneumonia and suicide by even larger multiples"".

82,291802599651461,Jesse James Finnigan,Kevin Figueroa,0,Unfortunately you cannot educate these Covidian cult members even their overlords came out and stated that a PCR test can test positive for weeks after infection because they are so sensitive that you can literally create a positive if you replicated enough. Also in the summer the CDC put on there website that the PCR cannot distinguish between covid and the flu yep they were continuing to use it until December 31 2021

90,3961519143859945,Anthony Lainez,Dawn Stickell Wilson,1,Dawn Stickell Wilson I am shocked we are still rising!! My god.. and it’s not a few numbers.. it’s hundreds a day!
91,3961519143859945,Dawn Stickell Wilson,Anthony Lainez,1,Anthony Lainez . YES It logically because here in St.Marys co. Our first positive case was well after the cases in the Northern half of Maryland.  So looking at it as it spreads the Northern half should start to decline before the south half of the state. But they have to look at the state as a whole. Everywhere is still on the up climb so this is not near over. It us sad but I would rather people live than to rush being reopened.❤

128,3957071057638087,Jimmy Conrad,Tony Cheezum,1,Tony Cheezum i do get confused by vague Facebook posts. You are saying we should protect those most at risk which is why we took the steps we did soo... good?
129,3957071057638087,Tony Cheezum,Jimmy Conrad,0,"Jimmy Conrad no. We've always quarantined the sick, never the healthy. And the general consensus among the sick and the elderly is don't collapse the country on our account. "
130,3957071057638087,Jimmy Conrad,Tom Farmer,1,Tom Farmer so you have to look at hospitalization rate not just death rate and hospitalization rate with this virus is high even in younger people. You also have to consider how people and the economy react to large portions of the population getting sick and a significant % of them getting really sick. That would also have a huge impact to the economy. Unfortunately its impossible to know for sure the best course of action but most are saying we should do everything we can to keep this from spreading and costing lives.  A certain amount of economic impact is likely unavoidable no matter which course of action or inaction is taken.

132,3957071057638087,Irene Cheng,Sarah Buchanan,1,Sarah Hard to say at this point. Right now the case numbers may be restricted by the availability and capacity of testing. Hopefully when we begin to use the newly arrived test kits from South Korea we will be able to get data that closer reflect the reality and the state can make better assessment of the situation. Stay safe & good luck to us all!

We are all stressed out, we are all irritated...but getting all trolly on the internet and trying to just be angry at random people is not going to help.   Why you are even saying anything about counties at all has my mind boggled as I was talking about other states.  This virus will hit in waves until we get a vaccine.  We will see peaks and valleys for the next TWO years (look I can do it too) and without a vaccine and without proper PPE and a consistant flow of medicines and equipmint we are going to continue to experience issues at the medical level with inundation and understaffing."

496,3936188623059664,Sonya Durst,Renee Congdon,0,Renee Congdon but then again you are a nyer... might take ya a min
497,3936188623059664,Renee Congdon,Sonya Durst,1,Sonya Durst uh yeah because being a NY'er means I must be stupid... uh huh uh huh. How about you being a teuchter?
498,3936188623059664,Melissa Thomas,Sonya Durst,1,"Sonya Durst if you feel that no one should be wearing a mask...then you havent seen first hand what this virus can do to a perfectly healthy human being. It's an incredibly selfish and ignorant (lack of knowledge) statement. Keep yourself and you're children home, or at best out of the public setting if you dont feel comfortable wearing a mask. It isnt just protecting yourself and your children, but others as well. You'd want others to do the same for you if you were immunocompromised."
499,3936188623059664,Brittany LaMastus,Sonya Durst,1,Not required under the age of 9. Under two is a suffocation risk.
500,3936188623059664,Carol Kinsey,Sandy Smith,1,"Sandy Smith a child might wear it if he thinks it’s a game, if it’s a bandana, parents will need to be creative"
501,3936188623059664,Kiersten Alexis Boppe,Sonya Durst,1,"Um, no. That’s a suffocation risk. "
502,3936188623059664,Brittney Potluri,Sonya Durst,0,"Sonya Durst nnnnooooo, that’s a huge risk for children. Children under the age of 2 should absolutely NOT wear them"
503,3936188623059664,Sonya Durst,Kiersten Alexis Boppe,0,Kiersten Alexis Boppe and it ain't for anyone?  Ones with panic  attacks? Ones with asthma? It's called watch them. My sons almost 3 and what's it's ok for a 3 year old but not a 2 year old?
504,3936188623059664,Sonya Durst,Sonya Durst,0,If you ask me no one should wear them.
505,3936188623059664,Kiersten Alexis Boppe,Sonya Durst,1,"Sonya Durst we are capable of taking said masks off and communicating when we’re having problems. 2 years old and under, not so much.  I agree, I’m not here for the masks either but it is what it is"
506,3936188623059664,Brittney Potluri,Sonya Durst,1,"Sonya Durst it protects people from getting the virus from those who are asymptomatic and don’t realize they’re positive and can still spread it. And yes, a 2 year olds mental ability and anatomy are different. I’m not sure why you’d say no one should wear them when it’s protecting you and your family and thousands of doctors are recommending it but ok 🤷‍♀️"
507,3936188623059664,Peggy Allen,Sonya Durst,1,It's nearly impossible to find masks that small. One should call  child's pediatrician and ask what to do. Common sense people !
508,3936188623059664,Shelly Flanagan,ROOT,0,Only ordered for RESIDENTS of MD. Those from other states who shop in MD are NOT required.
509,3936188623059664,Patricia Dupain,Shelly Flanagan,1,"Shelly Flanagan sorry, but that makes NO sense "
510,3936188623059664,Melissa Lutz,Shelly Flanagan,1,Listen to the briefing again then you will know if he says for Marylanders or for all.that enter a public place in Maryland. If you are a essential worker and you live in Md but work in DE you are allowed to go there most have letters on them from their employer. That rule only applies to those going out of state to shop...hang out...non essential business.
511,3936188623059664,Michelle Flynn Thorfinnsson,Sandy Smith,1,"Sandy Smith That’s simply not true.  My daughter, a Maryland resident, travels to her job at the Wilmington VA Hospital everyday with no issues "
512,3936188623059664,Cheryl Winters Kearchner,Peggy Allen,1,Peggy Allen starts the 17th.
513,3936188623059664,Paul Higgins,Claudia Spiker,1,"Claudia Spiker $5,000 fine"
514,3936188623059664,Brittany LaMastus,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan come in my store with out a mask and people will be refused service and told to leave.
515,3936188623059664,Claudia Spiker,Shelly Flanagan,1,Try to walk into a Maryland store this weekend without a mask... don’t worry just flash your out of state ID and they will say oh you are special you don’t need a mask..  I hope they kick your a**to the curb just because you are so ignorant you don’t think you have to follow Md laws while in the state of Maryland 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️😂
516,3936188623059664,Christy Parker,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan - Has anyone in this thread actually READ the order?  Because that would be the relevant part.
517,3936188623059664,Christy Parker,Shelly Flanagan,1,"Shelly Flanagan - here’s a link to the actual Executive Order.  It says everyone, not just Marylanders.  https://governor.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Masks-and-Physical-Distancing-4.15.20.pdf"
518,3936188623059664,Biggi Jameson,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan BS
519,3936188623059664,Claudia Spiker,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan are you sure about that? If you are in any state you have to follow that states rules. Doesn’t matter where you live.   If md has a law you must wear a mask when in a md business it doesn’t exempt you from doing so because you came here from another state
520,3936188623059664,Claudia Spiker,Peggy Allen,1,Peggy Allen that Start’s this Saturday at 7am
521,3936188623059664,Peggy Allen,Claudia Spiker,1,Claudia Spiker according to Governor Hogan it starts after today

523,3936188623059664,Esther Reynolds Cusimano,Shelly Flanagan,1,Ordered mine #maryland
524,3936188623059664,Juanita Merrill,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan Pa has the same orders too..I think its stupid myself after all.this time why noe2
525,3936188623059664,Shelly Flanagan,Claudia Spiker,0,Claudia Spiker IF the GEO says MD residents then he can not compell residents from other states to follow it.  IF it says inside the state of MD anyone who enters MD must abide by it.  It is a wording issue.  From what I was told it says MD residents.
526,3936188623059664,Claudia Spiker,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan semantics... the rule is for Marylanders.. and when in Maryland.... you will do what’s required if the rest of us. If you don’t believe me try to walk in a store this weekend without a mask
527,3936188623059664,Renee Congdon,Juanita Merrill,1,"Juanita Merrill if it's so stupid then please do us all a favor and go lick a door knob. The death rate went to over 2,000 yesterday after it was hovering around 1,500 the past week because people think the covid rules are stupid and it's really boring and I'm going to do whatever I want no matter what.

528,3936188623059664,Dawn Birgensmith,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan thank you for that! I donate blood and was wondering.
529,3936188623059664,Terry Jones,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan Delaware will be next.  New York and New Jersey have ordered it too.
530,3936188623059664,Peggy Allen,Shelly Flanagan,1,If you enter any public areas in Maryland they will tell you that you are required to have a mask..no matter WHERE you are from
531,3936188623059664,Sandy Smith,Shelly Flanagan,1,But people with Maryland license plates can't go to Delaware. Including people who own homes in Delaware but have Maryland license plate.
532,3936188623059664,Sam Amanda Clark,Shelly Flanagan,1,A mask is required in any of the listed establishments regardless of where you are from.
533,3936188623059664,Linda Ann,Shelly Flanagan,1,"And vice versa ,De residents can't come to MD to their home."
534,3936188623059664,Penny Hughes,Shelly Flanagan,1,Shelly Flanagan 😳
535,3936188623059664,Christy Parker,Sandy Smith,1,"Sandy Smith - When did that start?  Because I have plenty of friends who live in Maryland, have Maryland tags, and work in Delaware who go to work every day.  They may get stopped at a checkpoint, but all they have to do is have a legitimate reason for being there."

WW II - You have to leave your loved ones and might never see them again.  2020 - But my kids need some fresh air so we're all going to the park. WW II - Your kids have to be evacuated and live with random good samaritans for their safety.  2020 - I can only Facetime my family and friends I can't see them. WW II - I have written letters, I'm hoping they're received and I get a response this year.  2020 - I am trying to order my food shop online, it's taking ages to get to me I need, alcohol, and all the other foods I'm craving. WW II - Are you coming to queue-up in the line for our rations-potato soup every day of the week?  2020 - The government hasn't said we can't go out, they just said we can but only once to exercise so I'm going to go meet my friends and do what I want. WW II - I'm not going out just in case a bomb drops so I will stay in listening to some music quietly because the air raid siren might go off.  2020 - Netflix needs to sort the streaming out I can't even watch a series without it crashing. WW II - We are sitting in the dark around a candle playing cards keeping as much light in as possible so the warplanes don't see us from above.  2020 - Every man for themselves, so I'm going to stock-pile as much as I can because we are more important than anyone else, never mind the elderly that gave us this freedom. WW II - I'm so grateful for this community, everyone is helping each other out when and where we can, we must stay strong.  This is the perspective that we should have, we don't know how LUCKY we have it and people still aren't listening.   Stay in, it really is that simple!  London Underground in WWII"

It is up to each individual to govern themselves accordingly, and ultimately each person is responsible for what they do and/or not do and how they handle the situation."

776,3918100121535181,Serina McDonald,ROOT,1,Please make major stores like Home depot protect their employees and customers. We had to go to a local Home Depot yesterday in a hotspot for Covert 19 area and 95% of the employees had no PPE. Not even a mask and no social distancing was practiced during shopping and check out. Protect their employees and the customers.
777,3915410155137511,Brenda Sanner Williams,ROOT,1,My hubby just went grocery shopping to get everything  we need for 2weeks....staying away from stores and people during this period .... we will survive and conquer this virus IF we ALL quarantine as recommended.... Stay Safe 💕🙏🙏🙏🙏

787,3914751328536727,VictoRia Tamayo,ROOT,1,In times like this... Unity is highly appreciated
788,3914587605219766,Jake Alta,ROOT,1,"Maryland should waive licenses fees and renewals for all Healthcare Professionals. Due to COVID19 It will be hard to motivate new healthcare professionals in the coming future, on top of that Maryland makes them pay a fee to practice. Let's have some compassion for healthcare workers as most are already working on a single household income."
789,3914587605219766,Bradlee Sutton,Jake Alta,0,Haven't they? Most have. At least for renewals.
790,3914587605219766,Jake Alta,Jake Alta,1,Nope. They have extended the time to renew. However you still have to pay to obtain or renew your license to practice in Maryland.
791,3914587605219766,Donald Gertz II,ROOT,1,Wth does race have to do with it
792,3914587605219766,Randy Pullman,ROOT,1,How about a chart the depicts the drop in the death rate for africans due to the virus?
793,3914587605219766,M Douglas Siekman,ROOT,0,"An analysis that would be more telling and accurate would be to compare the number of those who have contracted the virus by race with the demographics of their specific county rather than as a percentage of the state.  The demographics of PGCo are much different than say Carroll or Queen Anne's.  That is certainly going to skew the numbers.  It is hard to tell if any group is truly under or over represented without that information since it has been shown that these outbreaks are location based.  For example, someone living in Western MD is not going to catch it from someone living in Baltimore City unless they come into contact with each other. If the analysis I suggested were performed, it could be shown if there is an equal distribution among race or not.  Otherwise, we are simply guessing and fueling controversy.    "
794,3914587605219766,Camille Ward,ROOT,1,"What is needed is mass testing for EVERYONE, period. I’m clear about the “why” of the infection rate amongst Black people but in the midst of this crisis we shouldn’t be fighting about the benefit or non benefit of disaggregate data...we should be screaming for access to testing for EVERY SINGLE PERSON."
795,3914587605219766,Leslie Westervelt,ROOT,1,But they only used MD data i believe. So its very slanted since 70% of MD is african american. So if we did this same data graph in China it would be Asian were most afflicted and African Americans in the low. I think this was a political move to gain better health ins. for African American  Marylanders.
796,3914587605219766,Sherry S. Wechsler,ROOT,1,"I’m saddened by so many of these comments.  We should all care about our fellow humans and our public health challenges.  This virus has exposed how broken many of our systems truly are and it should be a wake up call for all.  This is an opportunity to study, learn and work towards solutions that impact society as a whole.  We are also looking at static’s based on age and gender.  Governor Hogan made it clear that the data was only that which is “currently” available.  This matters. We can only successfully rebuild if the foundation upon which we rebuild is strong.    "
797,3914587605219766,Brenda Nash,ROOT,1,I would like to know by party Dem  or Republican
798,3914587605219766,Jude Stately Sees,ROOT,1,Who cares what color the patients are? People are dying and the virus doesn't discriminate! Waste of money and time and a bit racist if you ask me!
799,3914587605219766,Andrew Hower,ROOT,1,This information is completely worthless.  Race has no bearing on who contracts this virus.
800,3914587605219766,Andrew Hower,Christy Parker,1,Christy Parker anyone stupid enough to believe that won't bother looking at -any- data
801,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Andrew Hower,0,"Andrew Hower - Not true.  There were several people in my friends list who believed it, but when I showed them that there were actual cases of COVID-19 in Maryland, their opinions shifted dramatically.  Unfortunately, the rumor used the fact that there were “no cases (at the time) in Africa.”  What it actually was was the limits to testing and reported that exist in Africa.  But the rumor mongers who spread nonsense rumors, either for trolling or for some more sinister reason, twist non-data to look like actual data.  Now that there is actual data, we have a way to combat the ignorance and confusion caused by the rumor-mongers."
802,3914587605219766,Andrew Hower,Christy Parker,0,Christy Parker sounds to me like you should try selling some bridges to people on your friends list because even a minute amount of research would have dispelled that rumor within a few seconds.
803,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Andrew Hower,0,"Andrew Hower - Sadly, no.  There has been a great deal of uncertainty and conflicting reports about COVID-19 from the beginning.  With it being a Novel strain, there’s much we haven’t known, so people are easily taken in by any “article” that sounds reasonable.  There were even people who thought that drinking bleach would help (not my friends, thank God).  There are people who believe that post that’s supposedly from a doctor that says that you should gargle with vinegar and only drink warm water and warm drinks and that will protect you from Coronavirus.  There’s a ton of false information out there that is gaining traction.  Because so much is uncertain.  But instead of mocking the people in my friends list, maybe you should be condemning the nefarious characters that are starting the rumors."
804,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Andrew Hower,1,"Andrew Hower - I mean there are TONS of people who believe the completely false claim that COVID-19 is caused by 5G.    When information is limited, it’s easy to make up a rumor that takes hold."
805,3914587605219766,Andrew Hower,Christy Parker,1,"Christy Parker oh I absolutely hate the people starting rumors like that, but lets face it, if you're going to chug bleach or believe cell towers cause a virus, there's really not much that can be done for that person.  on side note, I can't fathom the mind intelligent enough to use a keyboard and mouse but stupid enough to think that black people are immune to a virus or that cell phone towers cause covid-19  what a bizarre paradox of intellectual curiosity and complete lack of common sense!"
806,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Andrew Hower,1,Andrew Hower - I think you underestimate the power of fear.
807,3914587605219766,Andrew Hower,Christy Parker,1,"Christy Parker that's aside to my point.  If you're so scared of a virus that (odds are you will survive) you are going to drink bleach (odds are you won't survive), than you're probably not going to be able to understand actual scientific data. "
808,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Andrew Hower,1,"Andrew Hower - OK.  I’ve got to exit this conversation now, I’ve got better things to do than to listen to you judge strangers.  Have a nice day.  Stay safe."
809,3914587605219766,Andrew Hower,Christy Parker,0,Christy Parker ok!  sorry that I think people that drink bleach are stupid!
810,3914587605219766,Bradlee Sutton,Andrew Hower,1,"Race alone, no. Race as a corollary, yes."
811,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Andrew Hower,0,Andrew Hower - It’s not worthless.  It helps dispel the recent social media rumor that people of African descent were naturally immune to the disease.
812,3914587605219766,Andrew Hower,Andrew Hower,1,a corollary to what?  it's also worthless seeing as how nearly a third of the 'data' is completely unknown
813,3914587605219766,Margie Arnold,ROOT,1,A complete waste of time money and effort get out to the community health care assistance protective gloves mask etc and stop trying to say it's a race thing it's a human thing we're all human we all deserve to be protected I guess when we get a vaccine their going to say so many to this or that ethnic group culture or religion etc
814,3914587605219766,Sarah Allen,Margie Arnold,1,Margie Arnold BLACK PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED NO ONE CARES THAT YOU FEEL ICKY ABOUT FACING THAT
815,3914587605219766,Margie Arnold,Sarah Allen,1,Sarah Allen Sarah I don't feel icky about that and my daughter is black so don't go there I'm saying instead of whining and spending resources use it to help people all people United with one goal get thru this with no loss of life Thank you

827,3914587605219766,Crystal Upperman,Kim Campbell,0,Location can define the population density...there is no skewing of the data if they are presenting counts.

829,3914587605219766,Dee Gilroy,Kim Campbell,0,Kim Campbell  😂your correct and made me laugh
830,3914587605219766,Kim Campbell,Crystal Upperman,0,"Crystal Upperman I agree,,,its is the racial profiling that I am taking issue with ."
831,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Kim Campbell,1,"Kim Campbell - This data is being posted at the request of the public, after the issue in Chicago.  It’s not the MD government trying to skew anything.  It’s them responding to a request of their citizens."
832,3914587605219766,Kim Campbell,Christy Parker,0,Christy Parker we have requested far more than this data...Trump started this BS saying that black people are more   sucepticle  to the virus. We wanted to know way more stats than this and the focus became race..This keeps our fearless leaders from having to give Real numbers on things that matter. It creates fear in the races and allows Them to channel Taxpayer Covid 19 dollars $1.8 TRILLION  into their own pet projects and pockets !!
833,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Kim Campbell,1,"Kim Campbell - I think that this sara was in specific response to African American leaders who requested it to try to dispel the myth floating around that African Americans couldn’t get Coronavirus.  For the past 3-4 weeks, I’ve seen frequent shares and re-shares of these posts and videos that say that African Americans shouldn’t worry because they are immune to COVID-19.  I was under the impression that these numbers were specifically aimed at disproving that."
834,3914587605219766,Kim Campbell,Christy Parker,1,Christy Parker thankyou for the clarification from that angle.
835,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Kim Campbell,1,Kim Campbell - No worries.  We’re all on the same team.
836,3914587605219766,Jonathan P. Tan,ROOT,0,Ok so can someone tell me what this data is supposed to answer? What is the purpose of this chart? What is this chart verifying or validating?
837,3914587605219766,Kim Campbell,Jonathan P. Tan,0,"NOTHING , it has a specific agenda as yet to be revealed. Demand Facts not Interpretations ."
838,3914587605219766,Jonathan P. Tan,Kim Campbell,0,"Kim Campbell  I just do not understand why we do this. That's fine we have data, but what is the data provided for? What question or statement is this data supporting? You can not just drop a chart without putting it into context. Just dropping a chart like this only leaves too much things for interpretation. Leaving things for interpretation only leads to bias rhetoric which does not help anything. "

842,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Garth Phoebus,0,Garth Phoebus Thank you!
843,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Garth Phoebus,0,"Garth Phoebus - And it’s scary, because a lot of my friends were believing it.  And putting themselves at greater risk because they did believe it."
844,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,0,"Chuan, and to think I would not learn this information had I just ignored you."
845,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,0,"Christy, yeah, not good! I think we’d all like to believe we are resilient to bounce back from anything and immune to most things. It is easy to get to that rumor when most of the reporting centered around China as the epicenter. This SARS-nCoV2 is still a lot of unknowns. Although there are some promising treatments, it isn’t a cure."
846,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Garth Phoebus,0,"Garth Phoebus True...but please understand that the Defensiveness comes from the many times the concerns of African Americans have been devalued and minimized-even on this forum. The way that you questioned me and how it was perceived all comes from personal experience. Normally, if someone asked me the very same question, and I provided an answer-their response was “Why does everything have to do with Race? or You people are always so sensitive or It’s not that way at all, or We have to agree to disagree, or the 🤣 emoji  or some other cartoonish gif....anything Demeaning. I appreciate your genuine interest."

849,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Kim Campbell,1,"Kim Campbell ....If that is the case, then Trump is triggering you. Trying to investigate a disparity in treatment and working to resolve issues of inequality where one Race is often discarded should delight you."
850,3914587605219766,Randy Pullman,Chuan Rogers,1,Chuan Rogers THE IRONY!!! BAHAHAH PHEW HAHAHA gfys
851,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,1,"Chuan, defensive much? I only asked a question out of curiosity. Some people actually enjoy a conversation, but sure go ahead and jump down my throat."
852,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Garth Phoebus,1,Garth Phoebus I am defensive. I must admit. Sometimes prejudices shape response and oftentimes experiences from prejudicial responses shape defensive responses.
853,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,0,"Chuan, can we go back to your comment about access to testing? I read the intent to be a breakdown of those tested, not those needing a test. The real disparities to me would be who is seeking tests and who is denied. Would that be more helpful?"
854,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Garth Phoebus,0,"Garth Phoebus I’ve known  5 people in 12 days that have died. 1 White, 4 African Americans... coworkers/friends/former neighbors...,very similar scenario as something that just occurred yesterday... Longtime family friend has been ill for almost 3 weeks. He was not able to reach his HCP by phone and went to the ER. Sore throat, massive headache, 102.7 temperature that remained constant for at least 4 days according to his wife, and a persistent cough like nothing he had ever experienced. The providers at Inova Hospital stated that a “flu bug” has been going around, and sent him home without being tested for COVID-19. He continued to deteriorate and 2 days later-Temperature-104.1, shortness of breath-rushed to Washington Hospital Center. COVID-19 POSITIVE. He is isolated in the ICU right now. His wife and mother are unable to see him of course, and has only been told that they are trying to stabilize him as he is in/out of consciousness. He is an architectural engineer with a 3 year old and a 6 year old.   He is a Crossfitter for 12 years....his wife states that he doesn’t have any known risk factors. He doesn’t take any medications. 48 years old African American male.  So are African Americans seeking tests-yes.  Have they been turned away-yes. This is what the CDC is looking into...the disparity in treatment and healthcare at a disproportionate rate."
855,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,1,"Chuan, all the instances you are personally connected to validate reasons why it is necessary. Thank you for explaining them. Have you expressed these with elected officials?"
856,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Garth Phoebus,1,Garth Phoebus I have contacted Gov. Hogan’s office since 4 of  the people are Maryland residents. He is extremely proactive with issues in the community and immediately the Maryland Health Department began the public tracking system which identifies the cases by Race.   The family friend who is in the ICU at WHC actually lives in Upper Marlboro. His wife said that she was directed to take him to Inova Hospital initially because of available COVID-19 testing by someone at Doctors Community Hospital.
857,3914587605219766,Christy Parker,Garth Phoebus,0,"Garth Phoebus - It helps to dispel the social media myth that has been floating around for the last month that African Americans can’t get COVID-19.  There have been a lot of posts about that, and it’s a bit of a social media based urban legend:  That somehow people of African descent have a natural immunity.  No one knows how the VERY FALSE rumor got started, but these numbers show that rumor to be untrue.  Publishing these numbers helps to dispel a dangerous rumor."
858,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,1,"Chuan, I hope your friend pulls through. I have noticed this administration is a bit reactive in good ways. It’s not like tracking the data takes any extra resources."
859,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,1,"Christy, I have to admit, I am not as in tuned with myths and rumors. I have not been on social media much. It is interesting to hear that."

863,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Kim Campbell,0,"Kim Campbell What are you afraid of? Really? Whenever there is an issue that involve African Americans, do you really even care or the fact that some concern is given to African Americans is triggering for you? "
864,3914587605219766,Garth Phoebus,Chuan Rogers,0,"Chuan, what do you think this data is going to help with at this time? I’m curious and not disputing its need. "
865,3914587605219766,Chuan Rogers,Garth Phoebus,1,"Garth Phoebus It would help African Americans with greater access to overall testing that other Americans enjoy so freely. Now what does that hurt? ...and why are you so threatened by that to the point that you felt compelled to question WHY? If the concern was over the disparity of White Americans mortality rate and testing would you still question why? No. Sometimes just a few sentences, knee-jerk reactions, impulsive responses reveal Biases."
866,3914587605219766,Tom Farmer,ROOT,0,How about a breakdown of the preexisting conditions of those that died?
867,3914587605219766,Karen Nieman,Tom Farmer,1,Tom Farmer that’s a good point as I have wondered about that too.
868,3914587605219766,Richard Kiester,Tom Farmer,1,Tom Farmer Isn't it racist that Asians are not contracting COVID as much as are Whites and Blacks?
869,3914587605219766,Tom Farmer,Richard Kiester,1,"Richard Kiester, Shouldn't be long before the social justice warriors demand . . ."
870,3914587605219766,Michele Kendus,ROOT,0,"The death by race data is not correct. There have been 138 deaths. The breakdown adds to 124: AA=55, Asian=6, White=39, Other=3, Data Not Avail=21 TOTAL 124. So there are 14 missing. With a data pool this small, 14 may make a significant difference in any interpretation one might try to make of this."

SITUATION: COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly. Healthcare workers feel under protected due to shortage of supplies, anxious, fearful, and emotionally exhausted.   BACKGROUND: Although devoted to the care of patients, healthcare workers are fearful for themselves, their families patients and the community at large.  ASSESSMENT: Nurses are fearful and anxious with little to no resources to help them cope in this ever evolving situation. Over the past 9 days, I, alone, facilitated over 40 debriefing sessions across 7 states.   Based upon YOUR CRIES for help a formal program within a psychologically safe space has been created.   RECOMMENDATION: Healthcare administrators and leaders should recognize the need for additional supportive measures to be put into to place NOW to shelter and support healthcare works during this emotionally challenging time.   In an effort to be proactive and forward thinking I have created a formal program entitled Who Will Heal the Healers? Debriefing the Front Lines to fill this gap.    Objective: By way of a certified debriefing specialist, create a psychologically safe space to express emotions, ease fear, and support healthcare workers in an environment with zero judgment or consequence to speak freely about their concerns or fears. The program allows nurses a place to let it out and lean into those feelings. The only way to conquer fear, to remain emotionally well, and physically strong is to lean into the fear together   If you are a healthcare worker and would benefit from a debriefing session, please reach out. I am here. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I have conducted  40+ sessions over 9 days time spanning 7 states across the United States. NO CHARGE. NO DONATIONS for individual sessions.  YOU DO NOT NEED INSURANCE.   If you are in a place of leadership and interested in learning more about how Heal the Healers Debriefing the Front Lines could be deployed at your institution. I urge you to reach out. A program overview, formal phases of tier implementation as well as credentials and CV will be provided.   Please know, at this time, I am a one woman show... a team is essential.  Together we are stronger.   Tara Ryan Kosmas, MSN, RN, CHSE, SOAR  Nurse. Burn Survivor. Professor. Humanitarian.

You move up to get someone who is right behind you some distance between you and them and they just scoot up with you, you can see people in groups selling drugs in front of cops with nothing being done, and workers being forced to work for a non essential company. Things need to be done. The essential list needs to be addressed in detail because a warehouse full of make up is not essential just because it falls under transportations “warehouse and facility”. I understand these are “challenging times” but that’s what it is a challenge that we must overcome. We need you as our governor to step up and address this issues so people do not have to risk their lives and the lives of their family for makeup, furniture, buying a new car, or a new phone. Force these non essential businesses to shut down that are using loop holes to stay open. I am risking getting fired for staying home from a non essential job to protect my husband who has sever asthma and could potentially die from this virus. I mean this in the kindest way possible “wake up!” People are not listening! You need to be stricter. "

Two negative swab tests on consecutive days are considered as the all-clear – meaning self-isolation can end and a patient can theoretically begin having contact with others, including at work."

But that the elderly or those with underlying health conditions are more apt to get it serious and/or die from it. The problem is, everyone only latched on to the “elderly” part and figured they were safe. So many younger people, thinking they were/are immune, or won’t get it seriously, continued to and still do continue to, ignore the warnings and are still milling about in groups, going to parties, hanging out together, spring breaks etc... not taking any precautions and sadly are bringing the infection home to those who are more vulnerable. To those who can die. The majority of people (18-45) have not taken this seriously. Many are asymptotic or presymptomatic and helping to spread the virus at high rates. Still going to stores to purchase non essential items. Not staying home. Exposing and endangering those employees who have to work at the stores/businesses deemed essential. What everyone needs to understand is, it’s not just about protecting yourself from COVID19. All of this social distancing, self isolation and Stay at Home orders are to protect those around you as well. Even 4 days after the stay at home directive, shopping only for essential items order and the curfew set, many Marylanders are still going about their days as normal and shopping in the stores for everything except essentials. Exposing dozens of people and possibly contracting the virus and taking it home to their families. This is going to get worse. Very much worse. Far worse than it should have because of those who wouldn’t and still won’t just stay at home for a few weeks. Or practice social distancing when out. Sadly it is going to take losing someone close or getting it them selves for some people to learn. Albeit learn to late."

So many younger people, thinking they were/are immune, or won’t get it seriously, continued to and still do continue to, ignore the warnings and are still milling about in groups, going to parties, hanging out together, spring breaks etc... not taking any precautions and sadly are bringing the infection home to those who are more vulnerable. To those who can die. The majority of people (18-45) have not taken this seriously. Many are asymptotic or presymptomatic and helping to spread the virus at high rates. Still going to stores to purchase non essential items. Not staying home. Exposing and endangering those employees who have to work at the stores/businesses deemed essential. What everyone needs to understand is, it’s not just about protecting yourself from COVID19. All of this social distancing, self isolation and Stay at Home orders are to protect those around you as well. Even 4 days after the stay at home directive, shopping only for essential items order and the curfew set, many Marylanders are still going about their days as normal and shopping in the stores for everything except essentials. Exposing dozens of people and possibly contracting the virus and taking it home to their families. This is going to get worse. Very much worse. Far worse than it should have because of those who wouldn’t and still won’t just stay at home for a few weeks. Or practice social distancing when out. Sadly it is going to take losing someone close or getting it them selves for some people to learn. Albeit learn to late."

I believe we are doing a lot of hiring from Baltimore County and Baltimore City. I would also like to state that most of these new hires don't care about stay at home orders or social distancing.

1208,3884295761582284,Matthew Jones,Brenda Gudino,0,It's because they have so few tests. They can only test those that have had recent contact with a known person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or people that have traveled recently. Until tests are provided in sufficient numbers to all the states we won't know the full scope because they simple aren't capable of testing all those who very well could have the virus.
1209,3884295761582284,Amber Andrews,Matthew Jones,1,Matthew Jones false. They don't even screen for travel anymore because it's now community spread and being exposed doesn't matter. You have to have symptoms and complications or high risk pre existing health conditions. There's not enough tests so it goes to the high risk who may need medical intervention so they can know exactly what they're dealing with.

1223,3884295761582284,Us Male,ROOT,1,"It has come to my attention that despite Governor Hogan's recent ""Stay Home"" Executive Order, the leadership of the Prince George's Public Schools is moving forward with a plan that needlessly exposes citizens of Prince George's County and Maryland. The plan in question involves the issuance of Chromebooks to students that claim no access to technology. This plan comes after two weeks of school closure. The plan calls for three to five PGCPS employees at each school to be responsible for contact with parents to get the devices distributed. The distribution is to take place outside of the schools in a type of curbside issuance. There are major concerns with this threatening and dangerous plan.  PGCPS could use its own television network to deliver curriculum or enrichment programs. Since we are quite sure each student has at least one television, there would be no need to leave the home. Programs could be done a couple of hours each day for particular grade levels. PGCPS should have initiated any device issuance plan during the first two weeks of Maryland school closures. PGCPS should have done any issuance through a centralized distribution point, rather than planning to open up all schools, to place more citizens at risk. PGCPS failed to have any contingency curriculum program available. PGCPS is using this planned issuance on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, as a ploy to maintain an image of working for the children. PGCPS is taking out of circulation, thousands of masks and gloves that could be used for emergency workers across the nation. PGCPS clearly violates the Governor's Order for all non-essential or non-emergency movement to cease.   We are calling upon Governor Hogan to immediately order the leadership of Prince George's County Public Schools to discontinue this dangerous plan that could potentially expose many to the deadly Corona Virus."

As long as everyone on the school side has properly completed hand hygiene and the computers have been sitting for the last 2.5 weeks they are doing their best to address a situation that is likely to go on for far longer than we want. The packets are a bit of a joke as they are school based 6-8th, 9-12th...guess what a 12th grader is further ahead in schooling than a 9th grader yet they are assigned the same math, science, social studies and language arts assignments. You should focus your energy on the parents who feel the playground closed signs don’t include their kids because they need to “run” off energy or the families that decide that because Sonic has an outside eating area that it is okay to eat there when all restaurants have closed their dining rooms and now only operate as drive through or curbside only.

His order was to protect more Marylanders, but what transpired here may have consequences for a long time. The same process should have applied for bag lunches also.

1243,3884295761582284,Joe Peterson,Jonica Gaskill,1,Jonica Gaskill um no it's to keep you hypochondriacs from wasting testing and people's lives
1244,3884295761582284,Jonica Gaskill,Joe Peterson,1,"Joe Peterson What are you even saying ""no"" to. I simply restated the steps. Not sure who ""you hypochondriacs"" are. I don't have symptoms and don't think I have symptoms. However, I do see room for a more streamlined approach reducing the number of people exposed and speeding up the process. I'll leave the ""wasting"" up to you, to waste your time trolling the internet. "
1245,3884295761582284,Joe Peterson,Jonica Gaskill,1,Jonica Gaskill sorry wasn't trolling popped up on my news feed as most relevant lol. Do you have any better ideals concerning testing methods on how it should be done?
1246,3884295761582284,Doris Acosta,Joe Peterson,1,"Joe Peterson it should be given to a lot of people, specially in the hot spots areas, just remember most people have no symptoms between 4-14 days, even though they are positive, highly contagious and giving the virus to everybody around them. More testing in general should and must be performed so the doctors know who is positive and who is not. The problem right now it’s the lack of tests, I hope in a week’s time with ABBOTT and all other companies on board we’ll have a lot more test to be offered to the general population. This is what South Corea did in order to contain the spread of the virus."
1247,3884295761582284,Jonica Gaskill,Joe Peterson,1,"Joe Peterson Thank you. Maybe. I would have preferred if they had put a triage station in the same place as testing. Since people know it's at emissions stations there will be those who do just show up. Having a triage/screening area onsite allows you to move along those evidently needing testing. You need a larger space though to manage it, like a high school. The results aren't even immediate and everyone is sent home unless someone shows up in really bad shape. This takes potentially contagious people away and out of doctor's offices and urgent care clinics."
1248,3884295761582284,Brenda Gudino,ROOT,1,Twice I’ve “seen” the doctor. First time “viral bronchitis”. Second time “bacterial bronchitis”. Over 50 and immune compromised with Valley Fever. Even had to call 911 with chest pains and couldn’t breathe. And still I have not been tested. There’s I feel more than hundreds of patients they are sending home with prednisone and a zpack and an inhaler. I really think they are trying to keep the numbers “low” here so it seems like Hogan did something better than other states. I’ve just heard too many stories of people suffering in severe pain at home. I’m one of them.

1250,3884295761582284,Matthew Jones,Brenda Gudino,1,It's because they have so few tests. They can only test those that have had recent contact with a known person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or people that have traveled recently. Until tests are provided in sufficient numbers to all the states we won't know the full scope because they simple aren't capable of testing all those who very well could have the virus.
1251,3884295761582284,Amber Andrews,Matthew Jones,0,Matthew Jones false. They don't even screen for travel anymore because it's now community spread and being exposed doesn't matter. You have to have symptoms and complications or high risk pre existing health conditions. There's not enough tests so it goes to the high risk who may need medical intervention so they can know exactly what they're dealing with.
1252,3884295761582284,Matthew Jones,Brenda Gudino,1,Thanks for more clarification.

1265,3884295761582284,Us Male,ROOT,0,"It has come to my attention that despite Governor Hogan's recent ""Stay Home"" Executive Order, the leadership of the Prince George's Public Schools is moving forward with a plan that needlessly exposes citizens of Prince George's County and Maryland. The plan in question involves the issuance of Chromebooks to students that claim no access to technology. This plan comes after two weeks of school closure. The plan calls for three to five PGCPS employees at each school to be responsible for contact with parents to get the devices distributed. The distribution is to take place outside of the schools in a type of curbside issuance. There are major concerns with this threatening and dangerous plan.  PGCPS could use its own television network to deliver curriculum or enrichment programs. Since we are quite sure each student has at least one television, there would be no need to leave the home. Programs could be done a couple of hours each day for particular grade levels. PGCPS should have initiated any device issuance plan during the first two weeks of Maryland school closures. PGCPS should have done any issuance through a centralized distribution point, rather than planning to open up all schools, to place more citizens at risk. PGCPS failed to have any contingency curriculum program available. PGCPS is using this planned issuance on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, as a ploy to maintain an image of working for the children. PGCPS is taking out of circulation, thousands of masks and gloves that could be used for emergency workers across the nation. PGCPS clearly violates the Governor's Order for all non-essential or non-emergency movement to cease.   We are calling upon Governor Hogan to immediately order the leadership of Prince George's County Public Schools to discontinue this dangerous plan that could potentially expose many to the deadly Corona Virus."

It has nothing to do with personal issues. I pray that the humor around this situation is reconsidered should this pandemic knock at the door of any of our family members or neighbors."
1271,3884295761582284,Dana Cross,Us Male,1,"Us Male parents and school staff are already going out to pick up food for their kids in most counties this is how kids on free and reduced are getting their meals every day. As long as everyone on the school side has properly completed hand hygiene and the computers have been sitting for the last 2.5 weeks they are doing their best to address a situation that is likely to go on for far longer than we want. The packets are a bit of a joke as they are school based 6-8th, 9-12th...guess what a 12th grader is further ahead in schooling than a 9th grader yet they are assigned the same math, science, social studies and language arts assignments. You should focus your energy on the parents who feel the playground closed signs don’t include their kids because they need to “run” off energy or the families that decide that because Sonic has an outside eating area that it is okay to eat there when all restaurants have closed their dining rooms and now only operate as drive through or curbside only. Let’s give the school system some credit, they were disinfecting after the schools closed and they are trying to do what is best for the kids that they serve."

The Federal Office of Occupational Safety and Health Administration has informed me that no masks or any other Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) can be used without proper training and certification. The point is missed that the process is not in accordance with Governor Hogan's Plan. The Governor did not mind the issuance, but he was not involved in the process. His order was to protect more Marylanders, but what transpired here may have consequences for a long time. The same process should have applied for bag lunches also. I will stop here and pray the data will verify that none of our neighbors are infected, because of actions taken outside of OSHA and CDC mandates. Be Blessed!"

If they are UNABLE to get to the store physically or is they don’t have someone to go for them & the store doesn’t offer delivery or doesn’t have what they need (not just out of certain foods but instance if they have an allergy/can not tolerate some specific foods) they should just not eat...🤦🏼‍♀️ IF they are a restaurant worker and don’t feel they should work I’m sure they say don’t schedule  me & restaurants are ok w that since not as many people are ordering but did those who do need to order it is essential... besides ALL of the ESSENTIAL people working aren’t having time to go home or even just pack or eat something when they are trying to combat this virus... what about the truck drivers who are out for days at a time delivering to grocery stores what do you suppose they do..... just stop working and grab a sandwich they packed maybe be there long drives they have or long shifts the police and ambulance drivers would like a hot meal and they can go quickly through a drive thru or take out... I realize a little empathy and thinking would require someone to come up with this but come on... what do you think those on the front line do when they don’t have down time to eat just not eat because there are no restaurants open & they can’t pack for long shifts because they haven’t been to the grocery store because no time between long shifts and they need to sleep not shop... 🤦🏼‍♀️"

I have quarantined myself since day 1 and have not been in public at all yet we are both sitting ducks for this virus. I pray every day that I am still going to be healthy on my Birthday in 15 days. Why not put your Senior Employees on Administrative leave as you've done with all other non-essential State Employees? PLEASE show some Compassion to those employees who are Seniors and have spent their lives serving the State of MD.  We ARE talking about our LIVES here!

Why are kids outside playing. Just yesterday in williamsport the teachers thought it was a good idea to drive around town blowing their horns nonstop with signs and stuff saying read, keep learning, etc with Windows down and most vehicles had young children in the back with their windows down as well. I see tons of seniors and kids out and about walking around and hanging out. This should not be allowed. Unless you are getting food, water, cleaning supplies or work you should NOT be outside! People are not taking this serious.  Also when you go to stores, throw away all plastic bags. Wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes, and wash your hands. It stays on plastic for 72 hours, cardboard for 48 hours and steel for 24. Oxygen for 3 hours but when we are touching these things we need to wash our hands. When you open a packaged food or canned food wash your hands before toughing another food item. Be extra careful. Stay safe and STAY INSIDE IF YOU DONT HAVE TO GET NECESSITIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Prayers for all! This is crazy how quick it has overcame the world. This is not a vacation! This is SERIOUS people! This is NOT a joke! This is NOT a game! This is LIFE and DEATH!  I work at Dunkin in falling waters, WV and just know we wipe everything down every few hours. We wash our hands every few customers. We you go through drive through wear gloves or bring sanitize wipes and wipe your credit card off or wear gloves if your touching cash. I wear gloves as much as possible but keep yourself safe. Wear gloves when going out shopping for food and cleaning supplies. You don't know who touched that item before you! We are not safe no matter what you may think.  We all have to stick together as a community and follow the precautions so we can keep each other and ourselves self."

Seriously why do you think they did that? I don’t feel safe and I am staying home but that in itself does not make me immune to the virus."

1473,3874883885856805,Angel McDaniel,ROOT,1,"Police need to be more on top of it. Yes we aren't on complete lockdown but it also says we should only be out to get items for home or to work. Why are kids outside playing. Just yesterday in williamsport the teachers thought it was a good idea to drive around town blowing their horns nonstop with signs and stuff saying read, keep learning, etc with Windows down and most vehicles had young children in the back with their windows down as well. I see tons of seniors and kids out and about walking around and hanging out. This should not be allowed. Unless you are getting food, water, cleaning supplies or work you should NOT be outside! People are not taking this serious.  Also when you go to stores, throw away all plastic bags. Wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes, and wash your hands. It stays on plastic for 72 hours, cardboard for 48 hours and steel for 24. Oxygen for 3 hours but when we are touching these things we need to wash our hands. When you open a packaged food or canned food wash your hands before toughing another food item. Be extra careful. Stay safe and STAY INSIDE IF YOU DONT HAVE TO GET NECESSITIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Prayers for all! This is crazy how quick it has overcame the world. This is not a vacation! This is SERIOUS people! This is NOT a joke! This is NOT a game! This is LIFE and DEATH!  I work at Dunkin in falling waters, WV and just know we wipe everything down every few hours. We wash our hands every few customers. We you go through drive through wear gloves or bring sanitize wipes and wipe your credit card off or wear gloves if your touching cash. I wear gloves as much as possible but keep yourself safe. Wear gloves when going out shopping for food and cleaning supplies. You don't know who touched that item before you! We are not safe no matter what you may think.  We all have to stick together as a community and follow the precautions so we can keep each other and ourselves self."

1489,3874148729263654,Mary Kerns Roberts,Megan White,1,"I completely agree!!  I work for an eye clinic.  They are only seeing emergency patients and have canceled all surgeries.  In my opinion, in our area on the Eastern Shore, there are NOT that many eye emergencies to warrant staying open and possibly endangering the health of the staff!!  If the emergency is that bad, they should proceed to the ER because, blessedly, our area has not been hit badly with the virus."
